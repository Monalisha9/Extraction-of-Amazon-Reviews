Captain Retail,5.0 out of 5 stars,"4.5 ‚≠êAwesome design, good specs and features. MiBand crusher.","The media could not be loaded. ¬†Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.----------------------üì¶ IN THE BOX----------------------·ç® The smart watch module with screen protector applied·ç® 22mm wide TPU strap·ç® Charging cable·ç® Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card--------------------‚åö FEATURES--------------------·ç® 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display·ç® Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,·ç® IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof·ç® 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby·ç® Bluetooth 5.0 BLE·ç® 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.·ç® App, message, social media and call notifications.·ç® Music control·ç® Menstrual cycle tracking·ç® 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.---------------------üóìÔ∏è MY USAGE---------------------·ç® At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn‚Äôt get allergy with sweat on this band.·ç® The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.·ç® The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.·ç® The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.·ç® There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.·ç® The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.·ç® There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.·ç® The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).·ç® Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.·ç® The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.·ç® I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.·ç® There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.-------------------------üíñ WHAT I LIKED-------------------------‚óæ The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.‚óæ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.‚óæ IPX68 dust and waterproof.‚óæ Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring‚óæ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band-------------------------------------------------‚ôªÔ∏è WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED-------------------------------------------------‚óæ More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.‚óæ Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.-------------------üç± OVERALL-------------------The MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. ü•á"
Gaurav,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Pathetic quality product, not even worth 1000 rupees. Its highly overpriced & is not as advertised. The heart rate does not work, its very slow & the touch does not even respond most of the time.Do not buy this product, its a waste of money!"
Ganesh Moily,2.0 out of 5 stars,Issue in smartwatch,I am not getting call notification in smart watch
Mahir Dalwale,1.0 out of 5 stars,Looks doesn't matter.. Completely Worthless!!,"Apart from showing accurate time & much healthy battery & looks like Apple Watch, this Smart (Fitness) watch do nothing as the company represents it.Don't know, how can people have wrote positive about this.It was the only reviews basis what I've bought this & find useless after the item received.I guess, it was their first Fitness watch & that's why they liked this.Trust me, please go for Honor, Huawei, Samsung bands.They actually shows you the fact-based info about your fitness. I've Honor Band 5 & I just loved it still.Afterall, brand is brand & that's the only reason their products are on higher side in terms of price."
Saurabh S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,worthless product.,this product does not support with one plus phones and this is worthless product. please dont buy it.
Shashank,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh yes,love itüëá","The media could not be loaded. ¬†Just received the watch,premium quality,looks good, touch is sometym laggy, will report soon after usage about accuracy control and performance."
Sneha K,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this product!!,"Don't buy this product!!I received this product on 23rd December and used it for 4 days down, the product automatically gets disconnected and they you will have to uninstall the Noise app which is essential to use this watch then reinstall, after reinstalling it doesn't allow you to connect to the smart watch this happens continuously, i tried turning off the watch and doing the entire process again but all in vain.... Absolute dissatisfaction ü•∫ü•∫üò¨üò¨"
sonu kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth coverage is low..max 1 to 2 mtrs,Bluetooth coverage is 1 to 2 Mtrs max. Technically This will not solve ur smart watch dream. Don't purchase or u will regret..I had ordered for replacement also and same problem found in other product also..this means it's s manufacturing problem..2nd issue very delay in process3rd issue it's having touch than also u have to lift ur arms to see the watch..one tap option not given.4th issue vibrator is not so strong like Mi Band.request to go for other watch not Noise clorfit pro 2..
A P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Read it! before buying,"The product is good for the price it is being sold. Accuracy is 3.5/5, look wise 5/5, battery life 4/5, screen response 3/5 but the main problem is with the application. Whenever the watch is out of Bluetooth range and comes back again in range of mobile it does not get automatically paired with mobile. every time you have to reinstall the application from the play store and again pair it. because of this all the data is lost and count start from ""zero"".i will not recommend this watch because of the application problem and makers of app also don't bother about fixing the issue.Go for mi smartband or any other band but just don't go for this"
Ronnie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money,"After using for 20 days, i am here to write a review. This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with bluetooth. You need to download noisefit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SNS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner).Heart rate monitor is closely correct. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Real count of a cumulative of 3 steps. Alarm works well. Truly water proof(follow the IP68 standard). Dont use in salt water, it can damage.My usage is very high and still i get 4 days battery back up. Its pretty good.According to the cost of the product, you cant expect more than that. Its recommended to use this product."
arpit,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not even worth 500 rupees i beg not to buy,This is the worst product ever purchased. But thanks to amazon they are refunding me and they assured me that i will get my 3499 rupees back. This watch and the fitness app never connects and is so useless this is just a display thing that you are wearing a smart watch. I guess a 999 watch on amazon is more worthy than this. Never ever buy my friends. This is personal 5 6 day experience and i have attached it to my oneplus 7 pro. My vivo iphone. Oppo and many more i have attached a picture of the phones so you don't have doubt that something must be wrong with my phone and ya the rating of their fitness app is just 2. Never never buy i seriously beg if you don't want to waste hard earned money
Hemanta Rai,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disconnects Everytime,"Is 3k the price for everyday headache?I was really to have found a great product for a great price but just after two days I see why this might have been sold at this pricing. The watch keeps disconnecting from my phone and reconnecting steps online includes reinstalling the app, unbinding the device followed by ten other steps. The device has disconnected two days in a row and I have been breaking my head to reconnect it. While it is a great price it definitely isn't worth throwing away 3k at something that doesn't work."
manikandan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy, horrible","Very worst product,. Recommend not to buy. Lots of glitches with this watch. Never connects sometimes, never vibrates on calls, never play music etc.. it works on its own way. Fooled by the positive reviews. Requested for the replacement"
Biswa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smart choice over expensive smart watch,"Background: I have recently purchased an iPhone XR. I really need a smart watch which can track my daily activity, give me a stylish look and provide me various notifications. As usual my first thought was about apple watch.Why I preferred noise colorfit pro 2?Apple watch is very nice, which is a real smart watch. But problem is poor battery life.Do you really think of charging ur apple watch daily?In today‚Äôs life already I hv wireless earpods, loud speaker and smartphone which need to be charged daily. Really I don‚Äôt want to add one more thing to the list.Do you really need a smart watch to answer calls or reply messages when ur phn is in ur pocket or near by (bcoz if phn is not nearby then these features will not work)? If yes then believe me u r too lazy ü§ó.Pros of colorfit pro 2: stylish look, working flawlessly with my iPhone. I can receive all notifications, read messages, control music (working nicely with gaana app, even if gaana app is not open, by clicking play button songs can be played). The activity tracker is also working fine. Good battery life.Cons: Only 5 watch faces (request to noise to update number of watch faces which ll make this watch awesome)Under bright sunshine, screen is hardly visible (the only thing with respect to which amazfit bip lite is the winner)Verdict: U can definitely try this watch though it is really not a smartwatch. In India, smartwatch technology is at nascent stage. So don‚Äôt expect much as compared to smartphones. Presently Smartwatch technology in India is like smartphone technology that was 5years ago. So better wait sometimes to use this smart technology at affordable price and let the rich people to enjoy the things for nowüòÄ"
Ritesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,No notification,Plz don't buy this watch it's not smart watch it's only smart band .. no call massage notification show in this watch very bad experience with noise pulse watch

Ashok,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovable product noise company,"Thanks to noise color pro2 smart watch really excellent product,and thanks to amazon speed delivery"
Buyer from Karnataka,1.0 out of 5 stars,Display image is misleading,The screen size of the actual product and what is been displayed in the product description are misleading.
shajimon I J,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't recommend..Don't be deceited by mere advertisement gimmick,When we try to count steps it gives a very inaccurate reading. Battery life is good after hardly a days use. Not looking great as far as value for money is concerned. The rating is done on the basis of my current experience. The charger or the charging port is looking inactive now...Need to get expert advice in this regard. I sent it to the manufacturer and got it back yesterday.. but I received a defective strap.but when I approached them for its replacement they responded negatively. Their service is very poor.
Patil,1.0 out of 5 stars,You can't request for replacement - very bad customer service,"Had issues with notification and connectivity from day 1 . Customer service is worst, You can't ask for replace you cannot request for replacement from Amazon you have to call Gonoise and raise a complaint they called after 3 days asked to check for few days and they closed the ticket without resolving the issue , I raised one more ticket they responded in 7 days and told they will not replace the device they will will take the device and repair it. Which will take 2 weeks as per the ""Company Policy"" ."
Abhishek R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Made in China,"I purchased Noise product as i thought it would be made in India, but sadly its also made in China.. All products of Noise are made in China."
Private,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Warning Stay away, Worst product ever","Worst product and no suppert whatsoever.I ordered to gift my wife hence lost the 7 days return window.Opened it on day 10, from day 1 the Bluetooth connectivity had problems, and after a few days the touch stopped working.Since I purchased, initially, I actually referred this to a colleague as well and he had got it replaced twice, still it was faulty.Now I have raised a complaint since 2nd Feb, there has been no response or follow up till today, already 12 days have passed.Kindly stay away from this crap, if you want peace of mind."
Anoop,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Watch is amazing,worth it","I am using this watch since 4 months. I am amazed by this watch as it has great look, it has amazing appearance. Battery back up is good, it runs for 3to 4 days once charged. Tracker n sensors operates smoothly. Overall this watch is worth it."
Sarika ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,Just love the product....buy it without any doubt üôå
Rajat kumar sahoo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Display is not good,Display qualilty is okay but other functions are best
KS Pixe LS,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great smart wearable at this price point!!,"Great looking piece for a smart wearable at this price point! And let‚Äôs take nothing away from it, the product delivers to expectations and is practical to the core. So to sum it up -What‚Äôs great -1. Display is pretty2. Long lasting battery3. It‚Äôs waterproof and dust proof (a must have)4. Light weight and ergonomic design5. Setup is a breeze6. Activity tracking, heart rate (continuous monitoring) and sleep statistics with added health and wellness feature is a boon7. Capacitive touch panel is slickNot so great -1. Limited watch faces2. Build quality can improve3. Lacks camera remote module (basic fitness band version has it though)4. Interface can improve to make it more intuitiveOverall a satisfactory product to own and worth recommending. Hope some of the highlighted creases get smoothened out with due course."
Harsh Vardhan Khanna,2.0 out of 5 stars,Device is good but the app will frustrate you.,There are no major issues with the watch but a big issue with the app. The fitness tracker unbinds itself everyday from the app and it is almost impossible to pair it again without uninstalling the app. Colofit Pro 2 is a total waste of money because tracking down everything on the device sounds good but synchronising it is a tough job. So I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this. I read all the reviews on amazon and bought it and was totally diappointed.
Dhruvi Sangani,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quality,The product is not of adequate quality. Alerts and notifications dont come up
Mukul,2.0 out of 5 stars,0 out of 10. I've wasted my money on looks only,Worst watch ever. Keep disconnecting from the phone . And the 2nd day stop connecting.. im getting calls elert. But no msgs elert.. I've restart my phone amd watch even their application.. still nit getting alert of msgs

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super,Amazing product i love it
Hitu Thakar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Noise colorfit pro 2 is a great advanced version of colorfit pro... Great work of all function.. Best part of its lookout... Best value for üí∞.
sachin kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Product,It's sensors aren't working properly. You will keep moving you arm but it will not wake up. Think before you buy this. Other brands smart watches are much better than this in the same price range. I regret my decision.
Siddharth,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy at offered price,"I have been using it for around past 20 days and here's my review.Aesthetic: It's best, almost look alike my series 2 apple watch.Accuracy: Heart rate sensor is decent. Although not 100% accurate, I would say 75-80% accurate. Step counter accuracy: 80%Response time: (when you face your wrist to see time): There's significant lag of 1-2 seconds which you wouldn't find in apple watch or any other high end watch like fit bit or samsung gearTouch sensitivity: It's not as smooth as I was expecting but at this price range it's decent.Colors: Colors are quite good in fact much better than amazfit bip lite or Lenovo smart watch.Battery: Pretty powerful so far. Almost last for 10 days after full charge even when app notifications are always on and also heart rate sensor is continuesly on.Note: You can't take call or reply for your whatsapp messages."
chandramohan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst responce,"Sir I bought my new noise colour pro 2 on 15/6 through Amazon from Appario retail private Ltd by invoice no IN-DEL2-310556 for rs 3499 .As per the instructions I downloaded the noisefit sports from play store and connected with my Samsung s20 it worked well .Afternoon while charging the Bluetooth connection when off ,I tried several times to connect through the app when I select to connect it shows refresh I tried several times. I need your help to solve the problemThanks & RegardsChandramohan"
Nikitesh Vadhani,1.0 out of 5 stars,No push notifications and NO REFUND POLICY,"1. No push notifications when i use the new app. Latest firmware. Latest app. Phone - OnePlus 5 with Android 10. (works great with old app) Everytime i open the app, it shows that the device is initializing and i receive no notification on my phone with the new app even when the app is ALWAYS on in the background and battery optimization is off for this app.2. Distance does not show when i start activity from new app - shows only time.3. Tracks the distance of run VERY inaccurately when i start activity from app. Shows distance of 0.7 kms after running more than 4 kilometers.I am feeling VERY cheated. I am interacting with Whatsapp support but their solutions are not helping. I paid so much more than Mi and Honor bands only to support Indian brands but the app-phone connectivity is HORRIBLE. I am on the verge of filing a consumer-court complaint unless you provide me with a solution or else provide me with store credit and take this watch away from me."
Shubham T.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Incomplete Order,Received a different product with missing accessories
Milani Chakma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth buying.,"After using 3weeks my Noise Colorfit Pro 2. I would like to write my FEEDBACK in details.. BATTERY is super LONG lasting once u fully charged its goes over a week. TOUCH is SMOOTH. As for SCREEN READABILITY and the NOTIFIER _ good for reading the TIME and the NOTIFICATIONS in bright SUNLIGHT. It's delivers basic nofications: incoming calls, SMS, e-mail, social media alerts..u can add MENSURATIONS cycles alert that's helped. The reminder of IDLE Alert and SLEEPING TRACKER Helps me alots. Via this smartwatch u can control ur music without touching phone.. ACTIVITY tracking is ACCURATE. Hope this will help..if u r looking forward to buy. Its worth money."
AYUSH JAIN D,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unsatisfied,Not satisfied with the features and quality compared to Amazefit.
Balaji,4.0 out of 5 stars,A basic smart watch. Ideal for tracking exercise,"Received this today. It's pretty basic fitness band in the shape of smart watch. Installed Noisefit app on phone and connected the watch via Bluetooth.1. No call notifications , whatsapp, facebook, messages notifications received on watch.2. Watch has only 8 basic menus. 5 watch faces to choose from.3. Watches switches off screen automatically in 5 seconds with no option to change it.4. Music control does not work.5. Menstrual cycle tracking app is not present.Looks like the seller shipped another basic noise fit watch in this pro 2 box.My suggestion - Do not buy."
pranshu,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very mediocre smartwatch, Apple Watch‚Äôs 5th copy","If you are just looking a Apple look alike smart watch then go for it, but if you are hoping for fitness band along with what a good smartwatch can do then please there are better products in market.Reviewing this after 4 weeks of use and using it for my workouts:Fitness:: I am over weight and not a workout person. Bought this so I can feel motivated once I join gym. The watch tracks your heartbeat and steps well but that‚Äôs it. It is unable to track whether you are working out or not. The calorie count only works for the steps taken. The app is never synced with the watch and won‚Äôt show data what your watch tracks.Touchscreen: The LCD screen of the watch will take you back in time when pixelated images and icons were the standard. The touch is not very responsive but does the work 70% of the time.Screen: The screen has got Bazels which is not visible in the picture.Overall a very mediocre product"
rajesh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good watch with some minor here and there's,"Overall good watch for the price.Writing this review after 1.5 month usage.Pros:Rough and toughIp68 ratingGood displayCool watch faces.Resembles apple watchüòÖCons:Limited watch faces.Accuracy in fitness tracking is low.Even after turning the auto heart rate sensor OFF, it sometimes starts measuring bpm even if you are not wearing the watch which is quite irritating and also consumes unnecessary battery at times."
Nitin sharma,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good watch for the price.,Very good watch for the price. Worth the priceFeatures are good. Design is very good and minute things have been taken care. Interface and app are also easy to configure and use. Watch looks goood.Few things that need improvement:1. more watch faces and provision to choose watch face from phone gallery. Have only 5-6 watch faces to choose from.2. Touch is little late and do not take commands sometimes. Needs a little improvements. Sometimes have to touch multiple times while navigating across. Over all good3. Flipping the watch to see screen lighting up have a lag. It should be faster.4. More control of music needed.
chandan,1.0 out of 5 stars,It caused rashes on my son's wrist,The media could not be loaded. ¬†My son used this watch while playing and sleeping daily since 24 Oct 2021. Today while dinner I noticed this wrist having a rash mark where the watch was worn. I surprised me. The watch is not suitable as it is damaging the skin and quit possible that it may be having some side-effects below the skin also
Dhananjay Kumar Sah,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth for the penny you pay,"Highly disappointed with this product, only thing come with this is the large display size and battery life, the rest remaining thing like function, watch faces, modes are disappointing.The strap material of poor quality turns black within a few days, the dial material looking great bu the durability is very less within a week or two you will find the signs of paint removal"
sahil kathuria,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,"It got automatically disconnected severaltimes and it do not show message/whatsapp/call notification on time and also not able to read complete whatsap message. So its not a smart watch its a dumb watch. So its a waste of money, better to go with normal watch (fastrack) or increase your budget if u really want smart watch do not waste your money for so calling smart watch of go noice ."
Prasad,3.0 out of 5 stars,10 days still 55% battery,"After using for 10 days, I see 55% battery still remaining. Hope it continues this battery performance atleast for 1 year. Sensor charging is fast.Sleep data is inaccurate (I slept for 6h & didnt use watch for 3 hours after waking up) it show I slept for 9 hours :)Steps/jogging data is not very accurate but does its job well when I compare it with data on Google Fit and Strava.As an entry level smartwatch, this seems to be good choice for 1000-1500 and not more than that. Strap looks to be of poor quality and not sure how will I repair it if the strap pin goes bad after accidental pull.Syncing with other app/services is touchAnyways, you can go for it if its your first smartwatch."
mayank shekhar jha,1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst. Do not buy. Junk!!!,"The worst purchase of my life. Ever. It is a crappy product with the screen clarity of a cheap streetside watch meant for kids. The features are too few and even the ones that are there are not very accurate. The touch function is slow and the watch takes a lot of time to light up with the wrist movement. In short it is slow as hell.Most importantly the app just does not work. It never connected with this pathetic ""fitness/smart"" watch and hence cannot be used to track or record or keep a tab on anything. Shame on this company that sells junk at inflated rates. Wish they had focused more on the technology and their two bit app rather than advertising with Rohit Sharma to fool unsuspecting potential customers. The sold out Technical Guruji also as always had nothing bad to say about this junk. I was taken for a ride. Hope you are not. I can not suggest a better product but can assure you that its best to stay as far away from this colossal trash as possible."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money,Expected more .. it could have more options in this smart watch.. very very less features given .. it is hardly worth of Rs 1000 only .. waste of money.. back press not given.. notifications getting very late responding ..
bharu,1.0 out of 5 stars,DON'T BUY THIS BLOODY BAND..DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I bought this band seeing the features..now i regret why i have purchased..i want to shift back to MI fit which is the best band in affordable price and it worth it..i have attached pics..pls take a look.. before midnight 12 it is showing as goal completed 10k steps..after 12 it is showing that my step count is ZERO..app never syncs the data..we have to manually sync the data else it won't detect..even detected with errors..if you are seriously a fitness freak or if you want to loose weight by making 10k steps daily..PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT..DON'T BUY THIS AND REGRET LIKE ME..WORST PRODUCT..IT IS TRUE THAT ALL GLITTER ARE NOT GOLD..I HAVE CONTACTED THEIR SUPPORT..ESCALATING THE ISSUE..NO PROPER RESPONSE..NO UPDATES TO THE APP..FEMALE MENSTRUAL CYCLE DATA IS WORST PART..I CALCULATE FAR BETTER THAN THE APP
Ashok,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DON‚ÄôT BUY,  READ MY REVIEW. NO REFUND POLICY","Don‚Äôt buy this product, here are few reasons:1. There is no refund policy for this product.2. The display resolution is very poor. You will not able to read msgs properly3. There is lag while you scrolling.4. App for mobile is very poor interface and crashes5. Battery life is 3-4 days only. Please note this, don‚Äôt trap in 10 days battery life statement.6. Better but Amazfit, MI brand.7. Company is investing more in advertisements than quality research.8. Chaeap quality."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Smart functions of the watch are not working,(1) NoiseFit app is draining phone battery real quick.(2) Call disconnect function from watch is not working.(3) Watch is not giving notifications for social media apps including WhatsApp.
Nikhil Todkar,2.0 out of 5 stars,2 star,Quality of watch does not matches with price. Low quality product. And body to screen ratio is also low.I thought MRP of watch is 5k and I am getiing it in 50% off price so it has multiple sport modes and fuctions but completely disappointed with it. It is not worth to buy @ 50% off price also.
KULDEEP SINGH SHAKTAWAT,1.0 out of 5 stars,Issues in Syncing Data,"Some of the Cons identified with this watch :1. Too big bezels. It does not look good when the display is ON.2. There is a lot of issues in syncing the data. The step counts, calories, etc are not getting pushed to the NoiseFit app and the transferring of new Watchface stuck at 0% and it stays forever until you force close the app.3. Also, the number of steps added from the NoiseFit app to Apple Health app is ridiculous. It adds the total steps more than 3 times everytime time you syncup the watch to the overall daily steps in the Health App making the count incorrect."
Pranoy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too bad to even comment.,It is better to invest money in fitbit or apple watch if you really need a watch. We wear watch so that we can track our sleep and activities without causing issues. This watch has ruined my time and faith in small brands. Neglectful service and support for watch owners.Received faulty device and was not contacted by them so that they can stay away from getting it returned or replaced.0 stars if possible for customer service.
Sahil,1.0 out of 5 stars,Please read this review before buying this product,"Important: Please read bride buyingHardware: The looks are good the activity mode has four modes that are good, there are stopwatch and timer which are also good, the battery backup is decent, it works for around 10 days.Software: this is the most pathetic app that I have seen in my life. The app does not do the tracking which is the most important part of this product. This version or the latest version of the app is not able to track sleep hours at all, it will show you steps for today but by tomorrow everything will be gone. I have attached the screenshots of the app that shows that I have walked for only three days and slept for only three days in last 25 days of continuously wearing this device. The other screenshots are from the health app from Apple that shows my walking and sleeping trends.The previous version of the app Was also not working as the app used to say update and there wasn‚Äôt any update in the App Store.The app has been full of bugs from the beginning and I have seen it like that from last two months. You can verify my comments by going in the App Store or play store and sorting the reviews by latest first. I don‚Äôt think the app is going to improve in futureMy verdict: please do not buy this otherwise you‚Äôll be disappointed. Thanks!"
Sanjay Sengupta,5.0 out of 5 stars,If u intend then go for it blindly,"This product is a nice watch in the market and I would recommend it to be bought definitely if one desires for a smart watch. Good battery life smooth applications, a bit of a problem when you want to reconnect with mobile. May be it bcos I'm using one plus 7T.The watch is very light and we'll designed also."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Average product at this price range,"I am using this product for more than 1 month now.Few good things:Easy to setupReally light weightLooks great on wristGood battery easily works 5 days after full chargeFew improvements:Big one is accuracy for almost all features: steps are really under rated, sleep tracker also I doubtFew features don't work like idle alert, calendar reminder etcOverall I was looking for a gadget made in India. So far really good on hardware (look and feel) but software needs to improve to compete with other China based products"
SAMPATH,5.0 out of 5 stars,A perfect Budget Smartwatch with Apple like looks.,"A perfect product at this price range ! Very similar to Apple watch looks wise. Display is IPS LCD , so you cant expect an apple watch kind of display , but it does satisfies the money given ! Limited watch faces .. hope so they provide software updates to enhance the faces . Overall a must buy budget smartwatch within the 3k range."
nanDan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why i bought this?,"I think most smartwatches below 10k are still immature, meaning, they do not justify the word SMARTWATCH.But now if you want an actual smartwatch then you either buy a Garmin, Galaxy or Apple watch which is crazy expensive.So the reason i bought this was just to see TIME and to see call/message NOTIFICATION while i'm driving. That's it.Now this is my first time experience so let me tell you why these watches are useless most of the time but very useful in some cases:‚≠ïYou always need to be connected to your phone and the noise app ALWAYS runs in background! This was so annoying because all these combined drain the battery too much. This is applicable to all watches that rely on Phone App, BT, GPS to be always connected.‚≠ïThis watch doesn't do all time sleep tracking. Meaning if you wake up in the middle of the night, it's counting will break and will show the data till the moment you woke up. Also, this doesn't track when you sleep intermittently in day time.‚≠ïVibration is good, Drink and idle reminder are useful, Brightness is enough for both day-night. Music control works with spotify and Youtube but no volume control. Watchfaces are limited and most of them are clunky but some are good so ok for the price. No lag and battery is 10+ day under normal usage which is again great for the price.‚≠ïI should say that tap to wake screen should have been there because sometimes wake gesture fails.‚≠ïOverall this watch is best for the price. The problems i mentioned is generally applicable to all budget watches so why not go for the lowest price one which actually offers value for money. (I mean you should buy noisefit pulse)Bottomline: Watches are still dumb and not smart until they rely on a smartphone to do everything.I'm sure there would be people who would resonate with my statements, hit the button below if you agree.üëá"
Ranjeet Nair,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product and good improvements but poor technical support don't expect any help!!,"I have used the product of over a year now and i have seen a lot of ups and down with this product. Now initially when i bought this product back last year I thought what a mistake and why? The product had lot of short comings for instance staying connected with the phone was a big challenge and getting help from technical support being a bigger challenge. There is no change in the part of getting help from technical support or help. However I have to say that the product has drastic changes and improvements making me change my initial rating and rerating this a 4 star. I am stingy in giving ratings besides there is always scope for improvements. Now let me tell you the good part, its a rough and touch watch with good styling on it. Definitely water proof you can go for a swim without worries and you would not regret. All notifications on your dial. The have also updated the app for the watch which you can use to sync with your phone which earlier use to give me trouble and now its a piece of cake. Now can you change the watch faces or only use the default ones, yes you can put your picture that you want using your app on the phone and its pretty cool. You can keep a tab on your activities pretty easily. In short for the pricing that its been provided its a good catch. I have recommended this to many of my friends and its a worth buy.."
Shriniwas Sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchase it now !,The grey strap is killing it . Best watch under 3k. The app is also super cool but they're some glitches at times but it's improving everyday.
Abhay,1.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading Description  about smart notification,"This realtime smart notification is limited to few apps, like WhatsApp Instagram etc.. but in the product description they didn't mentioned this. Pls be careful while buying product cannot be returned . Customer support is very very very poor . Even Amazon customer care executive was not ready to report this misleading description. They asked to call manufacturer not to Amazon"
Umesh K.,1.0 out of 5 stars,This watch is nothing just a scam,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Heart beat and blood O2 measuring feature is fake they just give any no. And shows that it's your heart beat. How can you tell the heart rate and blood O2 of the strap. Don't buy this.
Alauddin Shaikh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only the design deserves the cost,"Look and finish is good, but below are the points you need to consider before you go for this item.1. Notifications are not reliable, some time you wont get the notification while your phone is ringing2. Vibration is as dull as you would miss the notifications3. forces to turn your GPS on and need to keep it on else it would work, that sucks your battery.4. Sensor data for heart rate is not at all reliable.5. keeps ringing during the whatsapp back up, will disturb you while sleeping the only option to skip this disturbance is to keep your watch on DND mode with a risk your missing your other important notifications.6. Senseless logic for OnDemand heart rate, it runs and disappear without acknowledgement and confirmation.7. This watch would let you know that your table has a heart which beats with a frequency around 50bpms :)"
Ankesh Pandey,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,"Here are the points for which i have rated this product on:-1) Step counter doesnt work live, i.e when you walk the steps recorder doesnt record2) The touch response to the display is pretty bad3) There is a lag of 4-5 secs in lift wrist screen feature4) Comes with a pre-set of dials and cant customize5) The notifications fills up and you have to manually delete previous record and until the new notifications doesnt come up"
Anshuman Shukla,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery is awesome, worth buying",I was looking for watch that fulfills the gap of band &watch in look of watch.It is worth buying product.Pros & consDecent battery life more then 9 days with full active operationsLook &feel is premiumCompany care for customers satisfactionNotifying me on the goNo cons yetWriting review after a month usage
Broken,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good smart watch....app needs improvement,"After using a fitness band (mi band 3) for 2 years a shift to a smartwatch did seem exciting at first. However, there is nothing so different compared to a fitness band, except for the large screen display for starters.Overview of the smart(band)watch:1. Does what it claims to do, with good not great accuracy2. Looks good on the hand, can not compare it to apple watches, but yes looks like a decent watch on the hand.3. Colours in the display are good for the price.4. Silicon strap is just ok.The reason for the reduced rating1. The app (noise fit) from ios is horrible, on the first day it kept crashing2. On the second day, it disconnected itself from the watch and refused to get paired again3. After all the efforts of reading FAQ's on the webpage, following the instructions - uninstalling, re-installing, forgetting the device, re-pairing, rebooting the phone and the watch, nothing seemed to work4. For ios there is an app, seems like a third-party app on the App store, that works well, even though it has a 2-star rating there (there are concerns regarding privacy there, the author/developer is Ashish Kataria)Overall, the smartwatch is good, the app is bad (mi app was far better too) - I bought it at a discount price of 2499/- with an MRP of 4999 (not entirely worth the price)"
Surjeet Paul,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless Product/ Waste of Money,Product is of worst quality & above that the company support is totally sub standardWaste of money
Karthik.byk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!!,"Excellent product with heart rate meter, SPO2 meter (I was looking for in this price bucket), fitness goals, alarm, call rejector, and many more. Only option I was missing is the call and message option. Battery life is good. Takes one hour to charge from 0-100%. Screen off timer setting is missing. Sometimes feeling screen is turning off quickly before checking the screen fully. Overall good product!"
Ravi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst product, Please don't even think to purchase this product...",Product software issue and touch not working properly....With in 15 days of usage this product is end and kept as a dummy watch...Noise service agents are also not responding after so many compaints raised and being following up with them...One of my office friend also purchased this watch by seeing me now he is also facing same issue...3k amount wasted...1 star because we can't right Review for the product
Ever-E-Thing,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noise Colorfit Pro 2 Review! Read before you buy it!,"This product is awesome. I have listed the merits and demerits below:Merits1. Stylish and comfortable.2. Good weight.3. Nice touchscreen display with good brightness.4. Consistent results regarding heart rate detection, step tracking and distanc tracking.5. Straps are soft, but becomes slightly dirty because of light color.6. It is quite durable. With no screen protector on, the screen scratched a bit, but still very less. But I also took care of it very well. Otherwise, it is durable till now.Demerits1. Once, I used sports mode Walking but even after walking for more than 4 kms, the tracker was stuck at 2kms. I think it is a bug. Note: The firmware is up to date.2. Sometimes, the watch monitors sleep even if I didn't sleep. In fact, I didn't even sleep while wearing the watch, thought, it would break.Till now, I found these aforementioned facts about the watch. It is my first watch and hence, I like it very much.Thank you Noise, Amazon as well as the seller."
Sunita,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Good product . At first a faulty product was delivered which wouldn't even work then they replaced it have been using it for four months now .Edit : has been over a year now and still works perfect !
Satheesh Kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Smartwatch which is good for nothing,"Not sure why and How this watch got 4+ star ratings.1.First of all the Pedometer just counts even if u r sitting idle which means You no need to go for a walk or Jog. Just sit and Gial achieved. Boooom2.so called Heart beat sensor which can track heart beat on toys, Water Bottle and what Not even on the Cucumber . Total disaster.3. Not sure about SPO2 coz for all the people the SpO2 usually lies between 97 to 100. Yiu cannot assure on SPO2 .And Notification ?? Damn... Once Yiu attend the call and talking after 5 Minutes Your watch ll start vibrating. You mean seriously??? . Notification or Sync delay for 5 Minutes ??The Raise wrist to wake up 30% wont work. Its so frustrating that I need to press the button to see the time though my phone which I purchased 3 Years ago have Always On display.Though the price is below 2K, The watch isn't serving purpose especially for so called fitnessBeware and stay away."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,rebooting issue even after replacement,the quality of product is good but the watch started rebooting in 15 min and had to set everything again and again that was irritating and also received watch with full packing but masking tape stick on its back side as it was used and packed again plz check our product

shubham kumar jain,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Notification issue, No refund",Synchronisation is not at all good. Watch get disconnected with in 10-15 minutes with mobile although application is running in mobile. All other things are fine. Due to disconnectivity you will not get each and every notification. Notification part isn't working as expected. Tried to complaint about this feature but this feature is not at all in the watch. And also there is no option to return and refund the watch. You can only get it replaced with another piece of watch. So be careful before buying some electronic items from Amazon now-a-days.
himagirinandan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best watch,"Best product. You can buy this product .Only problem is that the screen is small.

Ganesh G,1.0 out of 5 stars,Why can I return and replace it with one better version.,The belt colour is not exactly royal blue colour... It's simply dull blue colour. Extremely unhappy with the service as they are not ready to replace and refund. Also why is there is restriction to return the product. I bought the product I did not like it so I don't want to keep it. Why should I pay for it? I can rather go for even better one which might cost 2-3 thousand RS more.
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,1/5 star as fitness watch and 2/5 stars as smart watch,"1) You can clearly see sleep data is not recorded.2) Heartrate samples are very random and only 2 samples during entire sleep time.3) There is no analysis for activity tracking ( bands worth 2k gives you - Route, Conituous heart rate graph, Speed graph, heart zones) - In this application - we can just see average heart rate and distance(which is not accurate) and no further analysis.4) Looks are good for the price, if you are looking for simple smart watch you can go ahead but features for fitness tracking is really poor.5) There are other minor issues with notifications, but i dont want to go into detailed analysis."
aviraj kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pathetic product, DO NOT BUY","I've always been curious to know how a smart watch functions and if it's helps. After doing some research, I came across this product - at first glance, yes, it looks amazing and seems to be ahead of its competition in the under 5k smart watch bucket.Within a day of ordering this product, it stopped working and refused to connect to my mobile app.For anyone thinking of buying this product, absolutely DO NOT!! It's all just flower-y marketing at the end of the day and the product is nothing like how it's shown. It's extremely, extremely average and I would put in some more money to buy a more reliable product.DO NOT BUY!"
Shweta,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good looking outside but inside not even worth 1000,"Have been using this for 2 months now. Already got LCD issues. Raised a complaint.Pros:1) Good looking, KIND of looks like Apple.. but kind of only2) Light weight and makes the first look at it really nice,, but as saying is ""looks can be deceiving""2) Little less price than competition.Cons:1) Looks good but watch size is weird as compared to LCD size, looks out of place when turned on.2) Touch is not free flow. Sometime have to slide 2-3 times to work.3) Outer button is very heavy4) ONLY 5 watch faces and all are very simple, not even one is as good as the competitors. Other companies providing 100's of watch faces. When contacted Gonoise, there answer is always that there will soon be an update. But they are busy releasing faces for NAV now and nothing on colorfit pro2.5) Notifications not working with my OnePlus6) Battery life comes out to be 4-5 days max, with bluetooth connectivity to 1 or 2 times a day to sync. Company claims 10 days, so this is 50% less.7) Heart rate looks ambiguous. It gives a fluctuating reading between 40 to 100. I had Lenovo band which had pretty much stable heart rate.8) Already facing hardware issues, with LCD getting white tint in corner and some discoloration in the center.Overall i can say, I was happy to buy based on ratings and their publicity about the features, BUT soon realized its just a good looking,, good for nothing watch.Look for other options before thinking of buying this, there are Cross, Huwaei and even if you have to increase budget go for it."
Praveen immanual,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst battery life and the watch quality,Never seen a watch like this and its been headache for me ...As it was in a promo it have 45 days battery life but in this it will be only 3 days of it and share about watch it was totally waste evening using this watch never seems like good.. Heart beat comes worst.. They is no proper indication and seems worst and about walking shows wrong I have an another app for walking but in this always shows wrong and wanna tells about sleeping time its shows wrong only ... Nothing was perfect in this watch...
thoshi,2.0 out of 5 stars,It is overrated!!,"I have used 3 smartwatches in past and I want to give you a honest review of the Noise colorfit pro 2 smartwatch.Pros:ü§© Wine+Gold color combination is nice.ü§© Charge will last you for 7-10 days depending on your usage.ü§© Extremely comfortable to wear. Looks good on wrist.Cons:üòµ‚Äçüí´ Noisefit app is slow!üòµ‚Äçüí´ The user interface sucks. Lags often and the display is average.üòµ‚Äçüí´ There are very few features compared to other smartwatches.üòµ‚Äçüí´ Watchface options are few and not tasteful.üòµ‚Äçüí´ There are only 9 sports mode.Who would want to buy this watch?!Anyone who wants a smartwatch for ‚Çπ3000 (during discount) only if you care about a good looking comfortable watch. If you want to track your fitness and have many sports mode like cricket, badminton, swimming, etc. go for other watches.The display makes it feel like its a cheap watch and the app also sucks. So put an extra ‚Çπ500 and buy the Amazfit Bip U. Trust me, this is a mind blowingly amazing smartwatch for the price! It‚Äôs worth every penny. I don‚Äôt know why this Noise watch gets all the hype.I also have an apple watch SE and I must say Amazfit Bip U (of course compare an actual smartwatch with a beautified fitness tracker but) does the job very well! Especially for fitness and working out, Amazfit scores well."
Yasin J I,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful battery life,Noise colorfit pro2 is cheap and poor way to convert a good working one touch Noise colorfit to touch screen watch. I have Noise colorfit which has a amazing battery life of more than 20 days while colorfit pro2 is having only one day battery. No optimisation for battery life .. Please do not buy this product until they have a optimisation for battery life.
Prashant Pandey,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor,Bluetooth connectivity issue. Battery drained within 2 days.Sometimes notifications doesnt work.Heart rate monitor takes too much time to calculate.Touchpad doesn't work sometime.I think its just waiste of money.
Syed Naved,3.0 out of 5 stars,Review After Using 2 Months.,"Not worth Rs.3499.Performance:- First of all, there is no sleep tracking. There are 9 sports modes - walk, run, treadmill, bike, hike, climbing, workout, spinning, yoga. There are No Call functions, No Camera control,Battery:- Lasts for about 10-11 days which is a good thing. You won't complain about battery anyway.Quality:- soft silicon belt is nice and no problem with the skin.Display:- little scratches starts to appear without protection, although with me using it rough, it is nice though.Disadvantage:- I bought 2 of them(1 for my friend) and the firmware version in the watch is different for both even after update. I had multiple customisable dials options available in one watch, while only 5 fixed dials in the other one which is really disappointing.Final verdict:- if you're first time smartwatch buyer, it is better than your analog and digital watch but not a real smartwatch as it misses out many functions. Would suggest you to increase your budget and get a real smartwatch from fossil, oppo or apple.Also if you're still looking forward to buy this wait for sale, the price drops significantly."
Abhishek Mishra,5.0 out of 5 stars,As for person who is looking for fitness goals in life can go for it premium looks!!!,"Most smartwatches offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself but some time calling feature do not work.

Arjun goyal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best budget smart watch!!,If you want more features then you have to add more money... If we talk. About the watch it has some good features that one should need in daily routine like notification of WhatsApp messages calls but the Bluetooth range is not that good also battery backup is not upto the expectations... I bought this for my younger brother as he just got his new phone and during his online classes when he was on break can put the phone on charge and watch gives notification after break gets over so quiet useful for him... If your budget is under 3k for smart watch then go for it..
Stephen ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Its convenient and easy to use ,go for it .","i really like this watch. Helps me track my calories burn and sleep . It also track different activities like yoga ,workout, cycling and many more . There is one thing this watch doesn't have and i wanted it . Thats distance tracking on bike. So it track your steps and give you approximate distance you walked but it does not track your distance when you are cycling . As they have cycling in the activity list i think they should have added distance tracking while cycling too. Otherwise watch is really good , touch is working super good . Convenient while you riding a bike .you can see your msgs n calls on the watch , i love puttibg alarm on it . Also one thing i love is you can customize the wallpaper, you can put your personal pics if you want."

Deepanshu Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If looking for Satisfactory Smart watch in low price, its a must buy.","I bought Noise colorfit pro 2 5months back, and i must say it is very satisfactory watch in such low price. It have all the fitness trackers and features. It gives you reminders of your periods and activities and more whichever you will set. You can also sync with your phone to get all your notifications. U can also pair with your music apps and change and play whaterver u like. I am most happy about the battery back. If it is connected with the phone the battery backup is almost 4 days.. n if u dont connect your phone with it, say u only use it for fitness and time then it lasts for weeks. I am very happy with the watch. N this is not my only buy.. i bought 2 more for my parents as well.I must also mention here i use a 35k smart watch as well but i am much happier with this one and not that."

Only 2-3 watch faces I liked .7) Heart rate isn't accurate but every watch will provide the same in this segment üòÖ I faced many problems in start before application and firmware update but now I'm satisfied. U can really go for this smart watch."

V N,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not worth the price, simply a step tracker, nothing more than that","Only good to track steps, else everything is dummy. Heart rate is far from accruacy, sleep tracking is flawed, distance is around 25% lesser for same number of steps when compared with Google fit.No way to check the history in the app and also calculations for weekly n monthly average is not logical."
mk,1.0 out of 5 stars,"good marketing but extremely low quality, not worth this price","- steps and calorie tracking is erroneous- Extremely low quality- huge lag with touch screen- Pairing with phone is nightmare, is always stuck on pairing screen inspite of trying all the troubleshooting instructions- customer care is non-existent, just on paper- only worth for buying to children as toy , definitely not for fitness tracking purposes- battery life is quite good"
Amit Shukla,5.0 out of 5 stars,NOISE COLORFIT PULSE Smartwatch,Best products by Noise.Noise colorfit pulse smartwatch.Smartwatch looks is premium suitable for men & women.Value for money.Battery goes 8-10 days depends upon our usage.Best product to gift your dear one.For more watch the Unboxing video.
SRIRUPA,5.0 out of 5 stars,worth  buying,"Below under 1& 2 is my feedback a 2/3 days back. NOT REMOVING ITFirstly for the price nothing can be better that colorfit pro 2. It‚Äôs not overloaded but Sufficiently loaded with features , like you don‚Äôt get sleep quality or too many sports options but are those really essential? It‚Äôs user friendly and has exceptional battery backup. I have used Garmin , Fitbit Samsung and Suunto. Wanted to try this inexpensive one and I am totally happy. Not comparing with the mentioned products but no other gave such wonderful battery backup.I initially was pissed off with the issues of registration issue and serial number. But YESTERDAY I FOUND A MAGIC PROMPT SOLUTION.Just communicate with NOISE on MESSENGER . All problems WEILL BE ATTENDED AND SOLVED IN NO TIME.I recommend buying this or pro 3 if you need more feachers,Prev feed back1) I registered the tracker on the Noise app. But have not received any mail or msg confirmation from them. I wish to be sure.2) did not find any model number and serial number. Needed it for registering the trackerKindly help me to get a confirmation."
gaurav sharma,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality, not recommended, money waist","They have updated the app and it's really very poor.Everytime u use the app, you have to refresh it again to synch otherwise it shows the previous days values.I have a miband and honor band 2, If i have to compare with mi or honor band their apps are far far better. On a scale of 1-10, i would give noisefit a rating of 2 and mi/honor band 7-8.Don't waste money in this."

Aniruddha Hombali,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value Smartwatch,"My first smartwatch. I think it has good value for money. For a low price of 2500 INR, I got a solid performer. I have had smartbands before, but they are like teasers for smartwatches. I wanted to have a proper smartwatch and decided to go with an Indian brand, since Indian brands like Noise and Boat have started making great products. I have to say, I am happy with my decision. The product is easy to use and setup. There have been no drops in connectivity since I have started using it. And most importantly, wearing it all day doesn't make me feel uncomfortable in anyway. It gives me a good track of what I need to know when I am working out and what to aim for. Now, I am really wondering, what is the value point for a smart watch? For 2500 INR I get features like heart rate monitoring, around 10 work out modes, calorie counter and notifications sync with my phone, what else is really needed for a smart watch?"
RG,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not 24 by 7 HR,For enabling auto HR monitoring. You can do it only from watch and not app as mentioned on support page. The monitoring is at every 5 minutes and not continuous as mentioned (24 by 7). So if you do a exercise for 2 Mintues and check HR you will not be shown automatic change until next interval of 5 mintues to complete. You will have to do manually. Raised same with Amazon tech team. They said will give replacement and if it has same issue will than solve. Clearly it's false advertising. Even youtube video shows continuous monitoring. However you see here that it's just block chart. Which again is not correct. There is no entry on chart for lowest BPM
Imtiaz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall good,"Such a deal beaker. Got it at 1600.But the problem is with the noisefit app, not working properly. Earlier i used colourfit pro 2 & my sister is having pro 3 and that time also app is not working properly and now also same. Noise should work on it. Tried a lot to connect with Bluetooth, but I'm tired.Otherwise watch is just wow.Better build quality, logo printed on strap, light weight & soft straps and looks nice"
lalit,1.0 out of 5 stars,I recommend to dont buy this product,Yesterday i have received the product from Amazon it looks amazing and stylish bt it automatically disconnect from the device and then it takes time to connect again and as i have enabled the whatsap notification from my phone bt am nt getting any notification of whtsap in my watch ..its so much irritating when u again connect ur device to watch ..dont know its a watch problem or its a software problem and i haven't use the watch for the full day and its creating so much problem ...
shuvo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product in the price range,"The watch looks good overall, and i am writing this review afer using it for almost a week, it is really good and comfortable for your wrist and the touch sensitivity is quite good, brightness of the screen is quite good for outdoor and it's splashproof, i.e, water drops, Or rain Or if water get spilled, it won't danmage your watch, but not suitable for swimming or using it in water. Everything is good for daily usage, i faced some problems too, like ""twist to wake up"" Function doesn't work everytime, and the screen on time is too low once you switch it on. And i would like to request noise to put more watchfaces in the app for this watch"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Accessories problem,"The watch is fine for the price; but, to get the accessories of this brand is a real task. Have faced the same problem for the noise color fit pro and pro 2. The charger of the previous watch had stopped working after a year; so I needed a new charger but it wasn't available anywhere however hard I tried; and the watch without a charger is useless. The same goes with the noise color-fit pro 2 after I purchased it after the previous watch. The charger is so small that it got misplaced in the house work. I cannot buy another ""original charger"" since noise doesn't keep their accessories easily available. So in this case, I got to use my watch only for 6 months since I do not want to risk my watch battery by using a duplicate charger available. Noise needs to keep their accessories as well, easily available on their website. It only shows sold out every time you visit their website and is never available once the product is more than a year old. What is the point of buying from this brand in that case? NOISE PLEASE FIX THIS! At least request you to keep your chargers and important accessories available!!"
Dr. Sunil,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Watch is on Continuous Vibration, Battery Draining very Fast","Worst Buy till now.All of a sudden watch started vibrating which didnt stop.Battery drained in 4 hours.Tried charging it, and again its vibrating.There is no option of stopping this vibration, customer care support team of noise company doesnt know why its vibrating.They have know solution and a continous vibrating watch with poor battery life is of no use."
ARYAN VERMA,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good please don't buy,I just found the looks good.Bad display.Battery drain out quicklyTouch response is very badLess feature than the competitive models and brands.More expensive than others brand and watch.Bad sensor.Bad application for watch.Battery backup is very bad only battery backup of 2 days to 4 days.The heart rate measurement is not that accurate and it's not very impressive you also feel very how to find out your accurate heart measurement on the app and on the watch if you talk about the display displays very bad and the brightness is not that good and also I want like to mention the touch and the response is very very bad.The glass is not that much durable and can get easily scratch on itAgain at this price you can buy another smartwatch better than this.The application noise fitness is very bad it is I don't have any feature if you compare with MI band 5 and MI fitness app.If you're listening to music and want to it doesn't show the name of the song.You can't get notification from any app but in MI band you can get notification from any customise or downloaded app.I am comparing this with MI band just because it is more expensive than MI band 5 but have less feature in less durability than MI band 5.You can easily get notification from your Instagram and WhatsApp but when somebody is calling you and that time it is not that good and also tries to wake up option is not that responsive just because if you wear MI band and noise colorfit to then you will notice that in MI band response very quick and fast IN raise to wake up.
Dinesh kumar,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wear this just for fashion....,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†My honest review about this smart watch is, that it is only good for sports functions, rest other features like pulse rate etc is only mind disturbance. Night sleep mode will give you only tension, not suggestion.From the day I had use this watch while sleeping it gives me mind disturbance, I can't sleep well. Before using this watch I had a good quality of sleep but when I used this ..it shows me my heart rate notifications daily.Then I searched on internet for normal heart rates and I came to know about normal heart rates .It shows 63 to 72 bpm when I am resting day time and night time it comes down to 49 to 65 bpm as I heard about this is normal pulse rate and I am a person who daily workout for 2 hrs and even I used to walk daily for 45 min.to 1 hour. Now I am used to Chek my pulse rate every hour and I became anxiety which resulted me no good sleep at night.Now I don't use this watch while sleeping at night."
Pooja Holkar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must Go for it..  Thumbs Up for it!!,"Okay! So I am using this watch for more than a month now. Absolutely stylish design, sustainable quality material, light weight and looks super cool. Now coming to the functionality, I downloaded the noise pro fit app, just turned on the bluetooth and without connecting the watch with bluetooth directly, I synced it with the app as written in the instructions. Within seconds, all my apps synced well with the watch and I get all the notifications of my phone like: calls, sms, WhatsApp, SNS alerts so that I don't have to peep the phone all the time. I read in many reviews that it does not support the apps and does it give notifications, I DO NOT AGREE WITH IT! I get all the notifications within fraction of a second. Its battery life is icing on the cake, lasts for atleast 15 days, like I charged it only twice post purchase. Functions like sedentary alert is an awesome feature. There seems no flaw from the developers end though! I mean u get all the looks, features and functionality at a cost of Rs. 2999, whereas many other brands provide almost same thing at a bomb of a price. I would suggest people to go for it without second thought. Only suggestions for the company is that if you could be more creative on the UI/UX part as in the digital dial, u must give atleast 2 or 3 options and fonts could be made better. Otherwise overall its a thumbs up guys! Giving big brands a run for money! Totally worth it!"
"Moly Paul, Guwahati",1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective product,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†It stopped working in a month. The product is really bad. I had complained to the executives from noise as well when they had called for a feedback. Now it doesn‚Äôt even get charged. It‚Äôs a waste. I don‚Äôt need this product. If a product stops working in just a month, I don‚Äôt want replacement as well. Refund my money."
Ankita Sood,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work. Waste of time,"The watch is a hit and trial. One day the watch wouldn‚Äôt connect to my iPhone. Frustrated I ordered a replacement, in the replace the sports section goes blank when you click - means the watch crashes on being clicked.Highly frustrating to work around it. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.Also there are 3 apps on App Store for it to sync and all are different, so you wouldn‚Äôt know which is the actual one."
Customer ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible refund process,I am very unhappy with the product..the appearance of the watch is way different than shown in the website images..i was not knowing that there will b some green rays which might b dangerous to us.. It was not mentioned on Amazon portal.. I got red rashes around my wrist after wearing it which means the material is not healthy for me..i am so disappointed with this product and I know I won't wear it again but amazon or go noise is not taking the product back.. Horrible it is.. I wanted to buy good quality of headphones from go noise but now I feel I will not buy anything from it and will never recommend this also.. I am not at all happy with the service and refund policy..
Sannat Bhasin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unusable (garbage app and watch OS),"The watch OS and the NoiseFit app are utter garbage.I will list some of the issues:1) Watch does not track heart rate 24/7 even though it has the option. It always shows my heart rate as 62 bpm unless I check it manually.2) Half of the time when I try to check the heart rate manually, the watch randomly crashes and restarts (losing some of the day's tracked data along the way)3) Don't even get me started about sports mode... It just doesn't started (maybe just for me, but that's a huge issue).4) The watch itself is half decent, but the watch OS and app make it worthless (for me).I do not care about the fancy features they tried to put (like music control) if they can't even get the basic features of the watch right."
Opinion on everything ;),1.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty in all angles except looks and built,Quite a let down. I bought this product as I had used Noise buds and they worked wonderful. But this was a disaster of a purchase. The sleep tracker did not register sleep and patterns. The fitness part was at best unreliable and there was just nothing else. Tried to return the item but got only option to talk to manufacturer or amazon technician who was ‚Äò0‚Äô help. So product was faulty but also Amazon service in this case was deplorable.
Prathamesh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Application and Syncing is not good,"Application is not good in watch and phoneWatch Activities are not syncing1. Cycling = I selected cycling mode and did cycling, it is not showing in Watch and app = I can see in my starva and google fit application2. Running = steps and distance count is not at all correct.It takes time to sync but my MI watch, google fit and starva sync is on the goLooks are good but It is frustrating that activities are not syncing.Giving review after 15 days of use"
vineet,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with the product.,"I've been using this watch for almost 6 months now, the heart rate tracker is of no use, it will only track the heart rate when you set workout in your Noise fit app, apart from that even if you are jumping or doing activity, the heart rate tracker will remain on resting. Sleep tracker is fine. Sometimes you have to touch twice then only the screen will shift to another option. Now, I can't even connect my watch to the phone, it gets disconnected automatically. Finally threw away the watch."
Premkumar,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not so great. Stopped working in few weeks.,The dial is not as big as presumed from images. The app is not upto the mark. BT Connectivity remains a challenge everytime you try to use it. It keeps searching. The watch is quite slow on processing as well as touch response. You need to wait for a second for the time to be displayed. The pricing is not consistent and they keep throwing huge discounts. Disappointing for people who bought at higher price and it going down over night.
chinmay,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The watch is perfect, app is the most useless","The watch is working as perfectly, highly recommended at this price point. as it can, there's nothing wrong with it. But the app it's the most terrible piece of software ever made, most of the time it does not login and it doesn't sync the activity from watch in the app, it syncs it in the homepage, but it does not appear under activities tab.It's amazing to see noise also has many quite expensive watches and all of them share this same cheaply made highly buggy app that doesn't do basic functioning.The support is terrible, I sent them an email related to app, I have not received any response.The only two very minor downsides with The watch turns display off too soon.If you are walking for a while raise to wake stops working esp in sports mode, after you get out of it it works like charm."
nikhil naik,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worthy don't buy and waste your money.,"When you see the watch on Amazon it feels like full touch screen but when you buy that time you'll realise that watch is not full screen. I was very dispointed.Other features are worthy accept the mobile app. After giving access to whatsapp still not receiving any notification. Sometimes app doesn't collect the information about your whole day activities and it just vanished from your app. Even if app is not collecting information but watch must have keeping it for at least 7 days. I had brought few years back other much cheaper fitness watch that watch is use to keep the activities for 7 days. But after paying so much money and watch doesn't keep activities information is just waste.You can even go to app store, play store and check the app reviews.Surly not going to suggest anyone."
Anurag,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY WORTHLESS PRODUCT,The app is too slow to respond and hangs everytime. The touch is also not that good. Mediocre watch...nothing great.REVIEW AFTER 6 MONTHS:Bought the watch in March and after 6 months in August the watch stopped working. It wont charge and it wont switch on.The customer care is so worthless that ypu can neither log complaint yourself on the self help as they ask stupid questions nor the customer care picks up the phone.Looks like I have lost my money.Word of Advice: DO NOT BUY.
Bhushan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth getting disconnected frequently resulting in no notification,"Updated- Now after application update on 26th OCT now connection is stable, but problem with its mobile app is yet not resolved, without internet connection app is not opening which is useless interlock.First impression- built quality of watch is good, but due to Bluetooth connectivity issue notification are not coming on watch. Many time connection of watch and mobile goes off automatically without any reason. It is very frustrating."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,No warranty. Not worth it.,"Bought this watch in December worked fine till March, then started facing battery issue. Battery started drying up in minutes. When approached the T.nagar customer care center, they told me some lame reasons that the watch has scratches and will not cover under warranty.Totally unacceptable. What has watch scratches has to do with battery problem.Waste of money."
Ajeet singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Product,I bought 2 watches and here is my review about noice colorfit pulse:Display is very nice..Battery backup is very good..Notification vibration are in it..Design is very stylish..Scroling smoothness also nice..accuracy is good..Apps notification are good..At this price the noise colorfit pulse smart watch is very nice
Shirly,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of Money. This product is over projected.,"I purchased this watch after a lot of reviews and research. From day one, this watch has shown me only the cons side of it. It's a low tech watch which is over hyped and projected, whereas the actual performance is at its lowest level.Here's a list of what doesn't work in this watch and app:1) Bluetooth connectivity not persistent. Keeps disconnecting through the day.2) Alarm on app and watch not in sync3) Shows only call and SMS notifications.4) Doesn't show whatsapp, gmail notifications at all as advertised.5) Heart rate not at all accurate or even close match.6) App auto resets device settings everytime u try to troubleshoot.When contacted Amazon and the seller, I was told that only replacement is there and not return. Wats the point of getting another device of the same kind which under performs than what was advertised and marketed. Bad marketing and app development skills!Over-all, this is not worthy of a single penny."
Amarveer Singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"After using for few months, battery went down to 1 day backup. Tried raising the ticket over the Noise website and whenever i submit request, it goes back to same page and ask to update invoice again.Called helpline number and they said they can not raise a ticket, even after i forming them that i am having trouble with the website. So i asked for a supervisor and agent said that i cannot transfer your call to supervisor until you have a ticket number and then agent hung up on me.Guys please do not waste your money, rather buy a product from any trusted brand.I have Noise Colorfit Pro 2 and also Noise buds solo and couple of months ago one of the earbuds stopped working and took 2 months to get it fixed.So both of the products from Noise were not good in tems of quality."
Srinidhi Sagar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not so Worthy.,"I have used this watch for nearly 3 months initially there was a reconnecting issue and after the mobile app update that issue was resolved. But now i don't get any notification other than call, It feels worst because after paying soo much you are not able to use the product. I suggest not to buy this product better to go with other company products."
Abhi,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Buy Fake Heart rate sensor,I turned on the continuous heart rate monitor at night and removed the watch and kept on a table and on morning I checked my app it shows the heart rate from 12 am to morning with 5 minutes of gap between each measure and I didn't knew that even table have heart rate .First I thought I received a damaged product and replaced it with a new one so I returned itBut again same problem or the heart rate sensor is fake.They have just randomly show a heart rate without even checking .And even sometimes the oxymeter shows oxygen level for my pants even that's fake .Don't Buy it's totally Fake .

MANAS RANJAN MAHANTA,3.0 out of 5 stars,Colorfit Pro 2,Looks Good and Batty backup also good.
Verified reviewer of amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing more than a sleep, and activity tracker. Useless for most people","There is no smartwatch features . Its just an activity tracker such as sleep ,heart beat and the steps you take . For most of the people it gives a feels like nothing more than a time check ..UI and dial interface are not bad too but they could have added a storage and vga cam atleast. Even cheaper products in marker come up with android and cam features .But I should say the unique design and quality is fabulous .. material quality and tracking sennsors too rich in condition ."
Vimal Natarajan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this...This is not a smart watch... It is a COSTLY smart band,"No notification received while receiving calls and SMS. If you want to get then your phone should be in your hand. I don't understand if my phone is in my hand then why do I need a smart watch.Very poor distance coverage. My Fast track reflex 2.0 works much better than this.I have tried replacing the watch, replacing the phone and both the apps available in the app store.PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICENow have raised issue with noise team as well (72570) and waiting for their response."
Yogesh Sapkale,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dead screen within a year, don't buy","Not worth the price. Also screen dead within a year. Only a small white line visible on the entire screen. Total China made, chala to Chand nahi to rat tak. In my case screen died so it's of no use except as toy for children. Don't waste your money."
Gaurav Babel,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic support and application,"Pathetic support and ticketing system .Firstly noise fit app on Apple says update available for app ,when you click and go to app store ,it doesn't show any update.Haven't been able to use the app.Also creating ticket on noise website is very pathetic with a very bad UI ,it showed error while creating ticket and when ticket was created ,they closed all tickets stating duplicate case and didn't provide resolution on even a single ticket.Pathetic experience, its always better to go for a reputed company like fitbit, Apple or Samsung or fossil watch rather than a cheaper substitute."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it!,"1. Watch unpairs suddenly and the data was lost. Happened twice in 2 days.2. Watch is not very responsive, does not wake up when you raise the hand. Not very happy with the product."

Sujna,1.0 out of 5 stars,Serious waste of money,"This product has connectivity issue. In one week my watch was connected to phone only for one day, I have been trying to connect the blue tooth but it just doesn't work.My sencere adviser is that this product sucks big time don't waste your time and money on this.I really regret buying this, not sure how is this a best seller."
Spartan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely disappointed with the product and the customer support.,Bluetooth keeps disconnecting every half an hour. I complained about this to noise customer support by sending email. They asked me to provide some additional details which was provided by me rite away. Thereafter there was no response from noise customer support. Extremely disappointed with the product and the customer support.
Aliasger Sabunwala,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the watch in such a reasonable price.,"There may be a few pros and cons which I had noticed, that need to consider along with this product described below.Pros:1) Reasonable in price.2) It comes up with all the base features and sports modes.3) You can check messages and abort the call easily from the watch.4) The battery is very impressive. It works for a whole week with a single charge.Cons:1) The UI touch lags much time, I tried to tap but doesn't respond well2) The wrist detection not so accurate. It happens so may time that I pull my wrist to watch the time, but it didn't work.3) Lesser watch faces availableThis watch can satisfy your needs if you are not a hardcore sporty person like me. That's why I wrote at the headline, i.e., ""I like the watch""."
Debipriya,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Smart Watch You Will Ever Find,"It's been just over 1 month I purchased this product from amazon, it's the worst smart watch one shall ever find in the market and total waste of money.Problems Faced:1) The distance reading is by far absurd, as every time the distance count is abnormally lesser (over 1km difference) compared to strava, google fit and mi band.2) No voice notification on km/ mile completion during run, unlike other smart watches.3) Syncing activity is very slow.4) The noise customer support is utter rubbish, they do not respond to any queries and complaints, as I haven't received any response to my email sent to them.5) No price guarantee, in one month the price has reduced from Rs.2999 to Rs.1699Note: Please don't buy this if you want a real smart watch for tracking activities, this is just a show piece and total waste of money."

Anil saklani,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product at reasonable price,","Touch screen should be scratch proof, as you can't avoid reducing off if with anything. If this improvement is done then it is an absolutely good product. There are no speakers in it. You can take call from it but you can't talk through this. There should be more watch faces. Faces available are not good enough. However it is having good battery life. Touch also ok. May be another option of always on for watch faces could be additional selling point of they add it currently it is not there"
Deepak Modi,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent battery backup but average build quality,"This is the first smartwatch I have boughtTalking about battery: it's excellent.Display is of average quality.Build quality of watch module is not so soothing it looks like very cheap plastic material. But straps are good.Integration of watch faces in app with watch can be improved. Sadly you can't use it's app offline to change watch faces. Everytime you have to download the watch faces , it doesn't saves offline.It would be better if noise provides stress monitor as well.By the way i am happy with this product.Probably this is the one of the best smartwatch under 2500.After 4 days:Does spo2 and heart rate monitor in smartwatches really work ??I am asking this as amazingly it also measures spo2 and heart rate of water, other liquid, and some solid reflecting objects also üôÑAnother issue is if i am in vehicle it increases the steps even i am not doing any physical activity.Syncing of noise fit with Google Fit doesn't work even after many try."
NARAYAN DUBEY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product noise color pro2 smart watch,"Thanks to noise color pro2 smart watch really excellent product,and thanks to amazon speed delivery.Pros of color fit pro 2: stylish look, working flawlessly with my SAMSUMG A50S. I can receive all notifications, read messages, control music (working nicely with All apps, by clicking play button songs can be played). The activity tracker is also working fine. Good battery life.Cons: Only 5 watch faces (request to noise to update number of watch faces which ll make this watch awesome)"

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Aesthetics - good; Functionality - Mediocre to Low,"What I like :- Looks good- Feels good, comfortable on the skin- Reminds me to stay active when inactive for a while- Alarm function- Timer functionWhat needs to be improved:- Calories burnt calculation seems to be not accurate- The calories burnt during the workout isn't displayed on total energy spent on the main dial- While working out, you can't turn on the timer (not able to switch from the workout mode)- Sleep calculation is inaccurateMy main requirements being the ability to tell time, have a stopwatch function without using the phone, etc. it's good. But if you want the energy calculation to be accurate, I would not recommend this."

Monitoring (Okay, not satisfactory)Cons: (Long list)1. Doesn't support notifications from Gmail app, Whatsapp business and more2. Heart rate measuring accuracy3. Watch facesFor the companyInclude some important features and notification in the update. Make it more useful other just just tracking. Just tracking doesn't make it worth, make it a smart watch not just tracker."
Kavita Jena,1.0 out of 5 stars,hopeless does not work,the day I received it I tried to switch it on by pressing the side button but it didnt switch on. I thought that being a new device the battery might be low hence not switching on. Later I Installed the app to pair the device then it automatically got switched on and got paired and I saw that the battery was approx 70%. It has been less than 2 weeks and I have just worn it for 2 days till now and it has suddenly gone off. I have tried everything including putting it on charge for several hours an pressing the button to switch it on. I have done troubleshooting by uninstalling the app and reinstalling to pair the device but it simply refuses to switch on. I have wasted the money. Please advice how can I get refund / replacement. as the return period is over.
Sumyuktha,4.0 out of 5 stars,External look and  feel is awesome,"Like:External build - Comparable to that of IWatch. Premium feel is thereAccuracy is good.All common fitness features are available2799 is a very good price for a watch of this size displayGood choice of face displays.Batter backup is decent.Dislike:Display is not full. Only part of the dial contains display.Contrast is not very good.Touch can be better.Notifications has a limitation of reading only upto 70 characters.Only 5mts bluetooth range, gets easily disconnected, especially if there are walls in between.NoiseFit app is heavily consuming battery on my phone. It needs location/GPS services to be ON all the time.I tried for one day, and it consumed 74% of total battery consumption. It was a deal breaker for me as i dont want any thing on my phone that drains phone's battery. But app as such has good UI.No reset to factory settings option."
prem soni,1.0 out of 5 stars,Chinese smart watch with poor material,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†Noise is Chinese Smart WatchI prioritise this smart watch not due to quality due to indian brand.But i found on the box its a damn chinese smart watch.1. Band quality is too much worst it is like 20 rs band. It is very hard i gor rashes on my wrist.2. Watch faces:- there is only limited watch faces due to witch getting bore soon.3. Not able to sync with google fit, healthyfyme and other fitness apps.FinalBetter to go with MI band 4 rather than this socold indian smart watch."
subhasanti bidhayak pradhan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good product at this price point,"Well, now that the product is in use since last almost a month, now I am in a state to write a review.Product looks good. But functions are not as expected. The response time to couple of seconds late. If you want to see the time, you can't see it instantly, rather you have to shake your hand a bit and after 2-3 seconds the time will flash. It's not convenient. So all the initial excitement of my son has gone. He doesn't wear it regularly now a days.Not good at this price point."
Garth Adam ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy,It's good as in built quality. But it keeps on unbinding and you have to do the full process all over again. It's keeps on disconnecting. I mailed and requested gonoise to add a reconnect option but they send me the binding process which was stupid and I already knew. Not worry it. Don't buy.
RS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid it. Very bad screen and interface,"The screen quality is very bad. The interface sucks, the watch dials are all disgusting. Just avoid. Instead go for Amazfit for 3999 which has better screen and interface with customizable screen dials."

divya prakash,1.0 out of 5 stars,My brother told me not to buy but,"It stoped working after 10 days of use. My brother told me that noise is not a reliable company... They look fashionable, they have lot of features but you will face problems with device in long term, but i saw the deal 3000 product in 2500 with spo2 feature...i jumped on deal and ordered it now my smart watch is in noise service center... device is dead ... can't start....never took into water or did any regresse activity with it."
BM,4.0 out of 5 stars,VFM product you can pick up at this price!,"A very VFM product that you can buy in this range. I like the details that are plotted on to the charts on the app. Especially with sleep tracking, giving the details about sleep quality and the start and stop time as well.The accuracy of this data is quite good too. I used to use another activity tracker prior to this and the step could calculation is much more streamlined on Noise compared to the other.Touch screen response is okay. Would have certainly loved if the touch screen responded to sweaty fingers too. If you are working out or jogging, it won't recognise your touch if the fingers are wet.Battery back up is good as well. This review is based on my 5 months of usage."
Muhammad KP,2.0 out of 5 stars,OK product with bad experience,"Writing a review in detail after using the product for last 1 week, i will be straight as possible.Watch: This is an acceptable product in this price range (bought for 2499/-). Design is smooth, material look durable and good quality. (It seems manufacturer is determined to copy apple watch style). Minimum functions. Sports mode has around 8 options (NO SWIM MODE, even though they boast it is IP68). Screen size is ok with good clarity. Battery seems holding as they claim (I have not activated automatic heart rate monitor, may be thats a reason battery holding).So if you are looking for a show piece or imitating smart watch, this is an ideal choiceApplication (NoiseFit ios variant): Worse than worst mobile app as of now. I have no postive comment regarding app. It was easy to install at around 120 MB, but pairing with watch is difficult, it takes ages to pair and some time not even pairing even though app detect the watch. Now when it get paired I cant sync any data from watch to mobile. When try to manually sync, its just shows *syncing* but nothing happens. So what use of smart watch if you cant record and sync data?!!!. Another issue with app is downloading watch faces. Only on initial pairing time I was able to download a watch face,(The app shows lot of cool dial faces, but what use if you cant USE them ??)remaining time when i tried in app it just shows *downloading ... 0%*, what nonsense is this, i mean if you are launching a product, make sure atleast it works properly and do what you market it will do.For last one week i tried installing/uninstalling app, restarting mob, pairing/unpairing/forgeting device but data syncing was possible only one time that also for a session. Very bad application/interface/watch firmware or whatever it is.So if you are buying smart watch for logging your activities and monitoring exercise regime, better dont buy this product. You can have a mi band for less price with loaded functions and a smooth application.Customer care: Initially raised a complaint for data syncing inability and what they did was forwarding a technical FAQ link for all their product. Being a tech pro, i had already applied all of their troubleshooting options so i replied that Problem persist, at last a customercare officer called and unfortunately i was entering a lift with boss, so told her to please call after 10 minutes. I tried to call back the number afterwards but it was not connecting. Believe me they called back again but even before ringing, disconnected the call and immediately came an sms stating they were not able to reach my number!!!, literally i was waiting for the call and i saw their number just flashing and disconnecting even before attending the call..!!!, speechless at the customer service of Noise, may be those customer care executives might be getting lots of call as they churn out product after product and people raising complaints after complaints.Winding up: Watch is good looking and smooth, but interface is very very bad coupled with strange customer care response. So buy in your own risk and for those interested in atmnirbar bharath, do check were it is manufactured.Will try to update after 4 weeks or if i get any updates..."
Arul anand,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product . Advice not to go with this one.,"Waste of money. It's calculating calaries not on exercise mode. Simply calculating on time and steps which we enter first .Once mode is on, it will calculate it's calories burnt even we are ideal . Not accurate .Tried to get cash back for this item. But they cleverly not given. Only motive to purchase not to give customer happy. Worst product I ever purchased in Amazon.Highly disappointed"
Vikas,1.0 out of 5 stars,A third grade road side product (Palika bazaar s low better quality items than this),"This is third class product don‚Äôt go for it. You get a better product of second or third copy of apple watches on Facebook marketplace or in Palika Bazaar, New Delhi.Cheap Chinese plastic used I guess. Filthy and shaky display with awful touchscreen.In place of paying 3k to 5k on these GoNoise watches, simply buy a second copy or true copy for rs 999 from a nearby grey market."
Priti Uniyal,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it.,"I guess it's hyped just coz it looks good and classy. But it doesn't work well.. I bought it few months back and haven't even used much. First of all, the automatic screen sensor stopped working after few days.. The walking steps doesn't count.. I've tried to track it with the app but the watch is not detecting any.. It worked fine in the initial days but now it's like.. I can only use it for seeing time and date. That, we can do in other better and cheap watches as well.Very disappointed. This was in my wish list from i don't know how long.. But now i don't even wear it.."
Madhuri Bhatnagar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product worst services,"Pathetic product, touch isn't working properly, doesn't show the messages, connecting and disconnecting continuously, doesn't support OnePlus.

Ameen BLR,2.0 out of 5 stars,UI can be improved. Features don't work readily.,"Many write the pros.

Dislodged from the watch. Not happy.SMS and call alerts are working."

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,After seeing so many positive reviews I purchased this product. It stuck from Day 1.

Better go for Fit bit.
Purushotham.H.R,4.0 out of 5 stars,Honest short review,If u are looking for a smart watche at 3000 range...I feel this is the one for u... elegant and sturdy...when compared to other same range smart watches this stands first...and don't expect too much here as this is the best fitness tracker and it shows notification...and u can't receive or make a call or send messages...this one is best for fitness freaks...as I daily run for few kms and also tracks my heart rate...this is useful stuff for me...if u are not a jogger or runner or a fitness freak...this is not the one for u...and never expect Samsung and Fossil Kind of features here...
Pradeep,1.0 out of 5 stars,Utterly disappointed,"Wished I watched the YouTube video that suggested not to buy this product. It has very limited functionality any it's over priced for what it does. As a brand, I feel Noise isn't worth paying extra for."
Avid_traveller,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst buy!!,We thought of honestly giving it a second go and again tried it with the replacement from Amazon.But yet again same issue1 Finding Noisefit app on google play store was tough.2 the watchface takes hours to get updated and sometimes it doesn't even work3 the connectivity gets automatically disrupted on its own.. You need to download it again. Reboot the watch and again start over. Happened thrice on a single day!!!!
Naanu Kannadati,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Watch is good, but app sucks","The watch build is pretty decent. The look and feel is nice.But the app is worst. None of the data is captured correctly. Worst part is you contact developers and they do nothing.Few examples of how worst the app is,1. Watch shows 6000 steps, but app says 110680 steps.2. You wake up at 7am and do your routine work till 8.30am. but app shows you woke up at 8.45amSo none of the data that gets synced with app is correct.If you just want to buy the watch for the sake of wearing it and absolutely have no intentions to sync data it's okay to buy, otherwise it's the worst buy."
Umesh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best budget smart watch.,"Bought during Amazon great sales and one of the best and value for money basic smart watch you can find in the market. All features work as mentioned by the Noise. Setting up the smart watch is bit of a job if you are not tech savvy. You can get notifications call, SMS and WhatsApp, telegram and many more. You cant calls on the watch and no camera or camera control (dont expect from a basic smartwatch)."
Tarasantan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Neither much usefull nor interesting,"*Don't have much watch faces to satisfy, custom watch face always show 24 hour clock, no way to rearrange date and time.*Does not support standard bluetooth heart rate monitor services and characteristics, so no external app can access it's heart rate in a standard way, as a software developer, I was too much disappointed with this.*This is not an Android powered smart watch, you can not install any external app into the watch."
Girish Nair,2.0 out of 5 stars,NOISE-Color Fit Pro 2,"Smart watch looks & build quality is good.

No NOISE watch Service Center in Cochin, Kerala."
Princess,2.0 out of 5 stars,Accuracy issue..,"Not so good,Heartrate monitor is zero.. no accuracy in steps also..complaint registration page is not working tried many times to write and submit complaint not working so better be careful while purchasing, now it's been twenty days I'm using slowly got to know it's negative side.. only looks doesn't matter here.. at first ull love it bcs it' has awesome looks and seems great on hands.. later on ull realise that doesn't really matters, unless it serves the purpose after paying 3.5k for just to check the time in it?? To check time in 3.5k we get more branded and stunning watches .. think bfr u click on buy button."
muddubasava,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Noisy, rightly as per name","Not sure how this product got such a good rating.

Then I briskly moved my hand front/back for 10 seconds - it immediately showed 10 ft increase. Wav! I checked wearing another brand's watch on my other hand at the same time for testing. This watch fared very poorly. My simple mobile does better tracking. This watch is an useless product, so better avoid it."
MUKESH,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Poor warrenty support,"After 6 months of use its battery started draining very fast. Raised a complaints to noise support and they are changing 2000 rs to get it repaired. they said warrenty is only covering software part, no hardwar or battery is covered..its completely useless. After so many followups they picked the product and returned after 2 months saying it's repaired and working fine. Surprisingly they didn't returned the charging cable and didn't replied any email. Finally I purchased new cable and then realized that after charging the watch is not switching on and even it was physically damaged by service unit. Finally I dropped it in my dustbin so that I shouldn't bother anymore. Do not buy this product its completely fake."

AS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic quality product and lousy customer service,"I had bought this watch as a gift for my daughter and within 2 months of usage it developed a fine line crack on the screen (see image). I wrote to customer service and they responded that its physically damaged and would require a hardware repair for the same. The cost for repairing your product has been determined as Rs. 1899.This when the product is under warranty and the damage appeared on its own. You can see from the image of the watch it wasn't dropped or banged around.And the cost of repair is 1899 when its listed on amazon for 2599/- might as well save your money and buy something of better quality which lasts.Low quality product, kindly avoid."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely really very good product I like this so much go for it.,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Thanks for the delivery system provided by Amazon first of all I'm very glad to see this smart watch under this affordable prices rate I used it for something about two week and yet I didn't found any problem in smartwatch hope so it will last at me as long as possible and the one thing that did not favour me is this sleep tracker which is totally waste it does not even senses the sleep and another badthink is that even when we are travelling or else we are going somewhere in train or by any means of transportation then the watch wouldn't track the sleep and and forth and even in normal condition also the watch does not senses this live rest all all things are really extremely good and like this watch I would wish to give his watch a five star but just because of one sleep tracker mistake I am giving it a post han hope so there update it for a do something for better result so that any problem that not occur to customer in future thank u i would love to use this both and I recommend you want to even at his watch it's really amazing really good thank you
Anchal,2.0 out of 5 stars,Utter disappointment,"First of all... I received different packaging than what i have usually seen on you tube etc. Which at first brings you an impression of duplicate product.The product looks good... I hoped its original but this product failed my expectations.I didn't get any notifications be it call or message or wsap. I have to uninstall the app again n again to make it work which as a result deleted all the previous tracking. I am highly disappointed. The touch works well though, but whats the use of a product when it can't serve the basic purposes."
Sujith Nair,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do Not Buy - Pathetic,I will request everyone not to buy this product. My personal experience was not good. I didnt do much reasearch before buying it. I use iphone Xs and NoiseFit Sport app is not available in the app store for some reason. Got an alternate app somehow but it doesnt show the watch model to choose from. Tried with an andriod phone I have but call or message notification was not working and I finally decided to give up and submit a return request.
Utkarsh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good for nothing (highly inaccurate data and slow screen),"Extremely poor product.Sleep tracker is way off and very less data on your sleep pattern (Honor band does a way better job and high on accuracy).Pedometer is a joke, even if you wave your hand while sitting it will increase your step count.Screen is of low resolution and less responsive and takes 2-3 seconds to wake up after a gesture move.Wouldn't recommend anyone to buy."

Priyanka,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality, touch non functional in 3 days","Gifted it for Diwali, but to my embarrassment its touchscreen became non functional within three days of purchase, moreover the refund request is still not processed inspite of no question asked promise by Amazon. Instead now noise has inserted a layer of mandatory truoble shooting, which actually is not possible for a gifted item.This is sheer harrasment and fraud. The pick of product for return wasn't done on time and hence now we are stuck with our money with the manufacturer. Please don't go ahead with this purchase."
Anu Amirtharaj,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a Budget watch but very limited options,, so think","ouch screen, sleep tracking is good.The watch is attractive sauve and with good display.color options of the watch is very appealing.Basic options like alarm, sleep tracking, saturation, pulse, step count is availble. But some upgrade know below points would be appreciable.It's a Budget watch and so with limited options which are acceprable. But please understand the watch doesn't have the option to attend the call or view the messages. I believe this can't be compromised. Back swipe and forward action is a hassle. The update face option is good but disabling and enabling is tedious job. I accidentally disabled option for choosing other photo and now unable to choose or have various option for changing the screen display.. Not very user friendly. I would definitely recommend to read the review before ordering this model. I would have prefer going for a upgraded version had I known of the limited option. So to sum up,, if you wanna gift someone but give them limited privileges -- this is the watch."
Piyush Batra,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it...,"It looks like you are wearing a cheap quality product and also not worth spending 3500 on this smartwatch.

I'm using Amazfit and it has a far better quality of outer and display. Dial size is 1.3"" and inter screen is not even the size of 1"". U can imagine the real experience could be. My suggestion is NO."
venkat,3.0 out of 5 stars,Beginner's smartwatch,"My first smartwatch experience and after two days of usage,Blood Oxygen level: it measures only on click. It wasn't tracking oxy level automatically. However it is helpful.Sleep monitor: either sleep start time or wake up time was not accurate. Other data are interestingStep/distance count: it adding step count to account even I'm sitting in a place. Don't know how it works.Heart beat rate: We know based on activity how our heart beat will be, it shows those heart beat rate in number (BPM). In auto mode it measuring periodically to keep in record. Atleast blood pressure data helps to track health but I don't have idea about the use of heart beat rate data.Sports modes: tracking all above parameters for all modes. Sport mode Exit option is not clear.Thanks for the price, no regret.Product accuracy is not sure and it's is just a tracking device so let's not take it serious. Generally we should have healthy lifestyle."

Munwar Shariff,1.0 out of 5 stars,Android App is horrible,I have android phone and installed the App from Google play store. There is no screen (watch face) which matches the image which is shown for this product. Also there are no good options for watch faces. The App runs all the time (taking up my phone resources). Tried reaching out to Manufacturer. Amazon is kind enough to provide me the REFUND. Thanks to Amazon for supporting the loyal customers.
Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,"I have been using this for more than 2 months and my observation is that the sleep tracking is not working properly coz i get the same time record everyday..other trackers are doing good...walking, sport mode, heart rate, blood oxygen..About the mobile app...it gets disconneted oftn and its being a big job to get that connected everytime.....Over all good one...Can buy it..."
amrapali,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst watch,Worst of the worst product ...just fooled by Amazon and noise company ...lost 3.5k bucks ....not even returning the products and there is no response from customer care also ....cursing myself for choosing such an worst company and such an worst app to buy the smart watch
Krishna kandregula,3.0 out of 5 stars,It Could Be The Best...,"A Mixed Reaction!!Watch quality is good and it exactly replicates the Apple Watch series 4 and the design is awesome also it is packed with lots of features and the display is superb (like AMOLED) but the software needs to be updated, the lift to wake up option sucks. The watch doesn't count our steps sometimes and it over count some time s but these all are of software issue and if it is fixed then it is a true ""beast "" in its segment . Overall for now it's been 3months and I'm satisfied with the features at this price."
Tanu Singhal,1.0 out of 5 stars,iOS app is missing from App Store,I received my ColorFit Pro 2 smart watch today and it can‚Äôt be connected with iOS. What the heck!App is missing from app store. Only android app is available. Without app it‚Äôs just a toy without sync. Even time displayed is incorrect.I called customer care of Noise and they informed that there is some technical glitch in iOS app and might take 24-48 hours.Are we living in a Stone Age where resolving technical glitch takes ages.Highly disappointed. Might return it back.Amazon delivery was superb. My trusted shopping portal
Tanveer Singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible product,"I had a harrowing experience with this product. Its terrible in every way. I also bought a Colourfit2 wrist band and the experience was just as bad. The wrist watch does not support cycling, it just does not register the miles. Their Customer Service is also bad it asks for so many details to just log a complaint. Buy this product only if you have time and money to waste not spare."
parameswaran,2.0 out of 5 stars,So So watch,"Stopped working the first day itself.Got it replaced by Amazon,thumps up for the quick action.Overall the quality is ok for 1900 Rs.Its unable to go back to the main menu by swiping simply when you open step tracker etc.display not so good.Bought it for use as a fitness band ,but better to by a band only ,if that's your need.If planning to buy a smartwatch go for higher models."
kalyani,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake watch,"Pathetic experience, trust me don‚Äôt ever waste your money on this waste product, such a useless, they don‚Äôt have proper app for iOS & watch doesn‚Äôt sync to the app, crashes every time I set alarm, der is no option to set reminders, doesn‚Äôt notify messages.I truly don‚Äôt understand how come this product so good ratings.I made a mistake buying dis watch on basis of Amazon rating. Fake watch"
RAVI ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Now Very Bad product Not buy this and worst money,I bought this band seeing the features..now i regret why i have purchased..i want to shift back to MI fit which is the best band in affordable price and it worth it..i have attached pics..pls take a look.. before midnight 12 it is showing as goal completed 10k steps..after 12 it is showing that my step count is ZERO..app never syncs the data..we have to manually sync the data else it won't detect..even detected with errors..if you are seriously a fitness freak or if you want to loose weight by making 10k steps daily..PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT..DON'T BUY THIS AND REGRET LIKE ME..WORST PRODUCT..IT IS TRUE THAT ALL GLITTER ARE NOT GOLD..I HAVE CONTACTED THEIR SUPPORT..ESCALATING THE ISSUE..NO PROPER RESPONSE..NO UPDATES TO THE APP..FEMALE MENSTRUAL CYCLE DATA IS WORST PART..I CALCULATE FAR BETTER THAN THE APP
Ruchi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Okish watch. Very limited features, colour is good","The media could not be loaded. ¬†The colour and appearance is good, features are very limited because of which I was thinking of returning the watch and look for another one. It was mentioned at the time of purchase that I can return this product in 7 days but when I tried to return and asked for refund it was refused and said that only replacement is available you can only replace and get the exact same watch in return."
Arus Chandran,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only for Mobile Notifications & Time,"The watch is beautiful and well sized for small wrist. Medical trackers are useless and I purchased this just for mobile alerts while I drive and on meetings. So, the Heart Rate sensors and other sensors if any, is always off which gives me a battery backup of 15 days. No complaints, touch is not smooth but can ignore. For this price, it is a good notification device."
Mangal singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product is just a toy for kids so don't buy this product for tracking the physical activity.,"This product look like a toy which is given by parents to their kids. This product doesn't give any single information in accurate manner like Physical activity distance measurements, heart rate monitoring, steps count and other activities which for they have made this product. Even my some other mobile app is showing some accurate results like step count, distance measurements calories burnt etc.This watch is measuring heart rate , step count, even after removing the watch from wrist for 4, 5 hr. Bluetooth connectivity is very very low even if mobile (This products app) app is running but distance is around 1 to 2 meter then it's disconnect from phone.1. Sleep tracking is very very low.2. Accuracy- Don't say anything about accuracy . It's doesn't give even a single activity in accurate manner. It's disappointed meüò≠üò≠ (I bought this product only for tacking the physical activity but it's disappointed me)3, Touch screen is not that much good what they have give in specifications.So overall I will give rating for this product in between 0 to 1. Not more then 1 out of 5.So I recommend you to don't by this product. It's useless. Waste of money.( This review is based on 5 days uses from delevery date)"
Dilower H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"Best start watch in this price range so after usage of 20days here are few things you need to know.1.Accurate calculations of Sleep tracking,BPM,Steps etc2.Water resistant3.Size is perfect ,battery from 100% to 5% in 9days4.Notifications from phone is visible but you need to download Noisefit sport and enable notifications as per your choice - incoming call ,what's app,telegram ,messages etc5.Screen protector - buy it from Amazon ""FCS ultrathin 0.125 mm anti shock flexible smart watch screen protector for noise colourfit pro 2 "" works amazing"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good watch but it counts steps even when u r traveling,"Watch is good , but app is the issue , it didn't synch with Google fit app . It's own app doesn't work properly . Only watch is good. But it'll count steps even when m traveling somewhere so I have to switch off it when I am traveling and then again on it back when I am walking . So I'll give 3.5 stars . Touch is good . I can control music as well ,which is good"
Sanket R Patel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect watch,This watch is good in this price range.
Bhavya vyas,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Recommended buy.,.I bought this for someone else who did not like it. Average. Light display is disturbing specially at night while sleeping it ligts up and destroys sleep .Steps tracking is average. I found mi band better at tracking and giving me a preview.The display seems good however swiping movements are not user friendly.A little disappointed as mi band was better than noise fit. Have been using this watch for 6 months now. Ready to trade it in
Vaseem Baig,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want for looks, Sure go for it.","Sync with noisefit app is totally blunder. Watch show some stats and app shows another. If a whole day you don't connect with phone, the app skip that day's data.Touch works sometime slow. Only look wise good product."
Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good one,"It was a gift for my husband and he loved it. He wears it everyday without fail. The only problem is the mobile app which has connectivity issues. Apart from that, it's worth it.The customizable watchface is something I love personally."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,My one of the Worst purchase from Flipkart.,My one of the Worst purchase from Flipkart even after complete notification problem is nowhere tobe solve. How can i used smartwatch if i can't even connect that properly with Realme 3 Pro and bluetooth connectivity is even worth than that. Whenever i try to connect with my Realme 3 Pro it's say error item 144 device can't pair what the hell meaning of that. All this problem i face are after replacing previous product. So i strongly suggest that doesn't ever think about purchasing this smartwatch device.
kirankumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"After using for 20 days, i am here to write a review. This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with bluetooth. You need to download noisefit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SNS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner).Heart rate monitor is closely correct. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Real count of a cumulative of 3 steps. Alarm works well. Truly water proof(follow the IP68 standard). Dont use in salt water, it can damage.My usage is very high and still i get 4 days battery back up. Its pretty good."
nirav patel,2.0 out of 5 stars,Its a hyped fitness tracker. .... please dont call it a smart watch,"The features of this watch are minimal. You cannot track workouts or activities other than basic walking cycling and running. Since this does not have an inbuilt GPS I thought I would use the noise fit app to track the location while cycling. The app does not provide any such tracking. i tried searching for the same but could not find anything online. There are different versions of the app. noise fit noise fit sport ..both didnt have any gps things or atleast i could not find one after hours of tinkering with the app and searching their official website.The worst part is that there is no sync between the app and the watch. If you start an activity on phone with your watch connected., it is not tracked.If you are planning to buy fitness tracker, its better to go for mi bands.. they are cheap and give good functionality. This just has a fancy display but rest its just a fitness tracker. Callign is smart watch is wrong"
abhi,1.0 out of 5 stars,DONT BUY IT,"when an activity is tracking it is resetting itself randomly, and my step goal is also changing as its wish, you can t depend on itThe sleep tracking is a big waste I guessdevice and phn are not synced if I unpair and pair for some hanging reason it automatically rests everything and the phone shows one count and the device shows zero.DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY ITDONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT DONT BUY IT"
Debanik,2.0 out of 5 stars,No Call Notification,"I bought this watch for call notification, rest features were just bonus for me, and on this watch call notification doesn't work!! Tried multiple smartphones, every setting tweaks, kept the noise app locked in RAM, nothing worked. For the rest of the features, i have no idea , oh one more thing, the UI adverrised is not the same on the watch! Returned this watch coz of false advertising (No Call Notification). Amazon is awesome for quick help!"
Amit kabadi,5.0 out of 5 stars,noise Colour fit pro 2. Go for it guys. Awesome product,"If u consider pricing , it is not possible to get any branded smartwatch in that price range. There are similar smartwatches are available on net with more features but nobody assures you warranty and one cannot say features which they promise will actually work once u receive the product. Gone through detailing of this product, and yes I feel one of the best product in the market."
rajeev singh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic Bluetooth pairing.,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Every thing is ok exept Bluetooth connection. Watch is disconnected each and every time.And it does not connect automatically have to search through app every time which is very irritating.
Santhosh.G Acharya,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money on this worthless device in my perspective..,To hell with this. Only its curve edge looks are the main attraction. Other than that its tottaly a pack of nonsence for an excess price. This does not satisfy any needs of any gentlemen in its features. Its a famine favourable device with a big display... Totall waste of my money on this battery crap device..
God of undead,3.0 out of 5 stars,Need more improvement,added/edited comments - received the replacement watch and it's battery is much better now. Still Mi Band has much better functionalities and better UI APP. Sleep tracking is poor and the afternoon nap is not considered separately (it counts with the night sleep). Notification alerts not working properly. Need serious attention with the app. It will be good to show weather updates in the watch. Find my phone option make the phone vibrate but no sound. Other smart watches with lower cost have better functionalities.
Aakash Desai,1.0 out of 5 stars,A worst product I have ever bought in my life!,"Not recommended to buy. A total waste of money. Apps are not developed upto the mark. Only replacement policy and no return policy on this product. Sleep tracking is not working, accuracy is at lowest, settings got automatically changed, auto sync is not available, connectivity with App is terrible, notifications of only few apps can be seen on watch, no manual app addition for notification can be done. If noise will refund then I would straight away like to return this product!Just 1 star for straps otherwise nothing to be rated!"
Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"It has all the features like sports mode, sleep tracking, music control etc, the build I feel is very similar to Apple Watch, nice price point, has sleep tracking and menstrual tracking too. Has different watch faces, instead of spending 35k-55k for an Apple Watch you can get a dupe like the noise one for a very lesser price and still can almost enjoy all the features."
Anand,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a budget smartwatch but upon comparison with Amazfit, the latter is a sure winner.","This is the third smartwatch I purchased in the family (first two were Amazfit BioU and BIPU pro). Upon comparison, this one is lagging behind due to these reasons:- Sleep tracking lacks REM- sleep tracking time shows inaccuracy- no GPS- not fully waterproof (can't take it to the pool)PROS- Slightly bigger screen- Was slightly cheaper when I purchasedI would surely vote for Amazfit in this price range"
Lakshmi K Iyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,ITS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!,"I always wanted to have a fitbit. This is really awesome with very good touch screen and has various facilities covered under one lense. It can detect your walking, running, jogging speed, keep a tracke of your heart rate, it has built in phone finder so it will help you find your phone if you pair the phone with fitbit using bluetooth. You can also set alarm like in mobile. It's very very useful. You also can set for call, messages, watsapp, fb and many more alerts. It also has a seperate tab for female health and periods tracker which keeps track of your periods and keeps you updated. This tiny mint device has 100 times more than what I had expected and hence it's worth the money.Charging the device is very easy.Battery life is for 7 days even if you use it every day.You can customise the watch face as per your convenience.It's a superb gadget."
Aniket,5.0 out of 5 stars,Classy Stylish Value for Money Good Product,"Writing this review after 15 days of Usage.1. Battery still remaining 12% after 13 days2. Add any number of watch faces you want to.3. Gets Paired very easily ( Im using Google Pixel 2XL)4. Display screen is good and looks are very decent just like a VW i.e Classy.People here have mentioned the above points repeatedly about these issue I have faced none of it. Before buying I have seen option like Skagen , Fossil , Titan and many more around the range of 12k coz the other like garmin and Samsungs and apple was way too costly.If you want a nice decent classy smart watch just go for it you will not repent . After seeing my watch in my office 2 of them have already purchased it."
ajay m v,4.0 out of 5 stars,2 Weeks Usage Review,"Good watch for health and fitness as of for cost range we expect more quality, as per 2weeks usage nice watch, it shows Bluetooth music connected but does not shows which song is playing, shows who is calling but unable to receive their call but only able to decline or quick replay, pedometer is bit good and accurate, sleeping tracker not as much accurate, battery life is good 9-10days, but the sad thing is there is no good collection of watch faces, only on the festival offer 1.7k is a good deal for the watch as per features & built quality."
Bajoriavinayak ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Watch ever,"Even for a Chinese product, this is garbage. The calorie burn tracker will give you different readings by a difference of 1000 for the same rate of an outdoor workout. There is no indoor workout support like boxing, cardio. The app will never be able to sync with the watch. So basically it's useless after 1 day. I should have gone with the Apple watch. Chinese maybe able to colonise Africa with their debt trap but I have learned lesson for life."
KULBHUSHAN,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad experience! Waste of money.,"I ordered this watch. It was not reliable as it got reset on its own within one week and all previous data got lost .On replacement with the new one, the second one worked fine for 1 week. On 8th day itself, that too stopped working completely and now it's dead. Have put it up for replacement under warranty which will take time. My sister also purchased the same watch which worked fine for 3 weeks, then pairing issues occurred and the application is still not working properly even after reinstalling it multiple times. Highly disappointed."
yogesh pant,1.0 out of 5 stars,WROST PRODUCT,"If you reading / looking at the positive reviews and buy it, well you have got the worst product of your lifetime. Don't waste your hard earned money on this crap product, i must say just stay away, buy Hawaii, MI, SAMSUNG BANDS INSTEAD....This watch have Bluetooth connectivity issues and disconnects automatically even if your phone in your pocket.....STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT....."
Rajesh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt hesitate; Worthy product with cheap cost.,"Compare to costlier smart watches like apple and Samsung its better at ‚Çπ3,000.Don‚Äôt expect too much. But it satisfy pretty much. If this one is your first smart watch means definitely make you cool at low cost."
Aashik Saji,2.0 out of 5 stars,Defect product,"I got the watch,but there was a line appearing in the display right through the middle so was a detective product i have got. And i chose to replace the product the same day i got it,because i like the watch for it's pretty good design and style,but there was no replacement option and obviously i could only go for refund option. And again i ordered the same product and expect the delivery in a couple days. Kindly make sure that i get good quality product this time with zero defects ."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy. Not up to mark. Not worth the discounted price.,The watch doesn't not have an always on display option and the wrist sensor works very late and is very frustrating.The watch only connects with the companies app and does not have enough features for the price range.The touch screen is non responsive. Poor user interface.The location reporting is inaccurate. It calculated 10km for when I only ran 8km and calculates distance when you're sitting in a car.
Shubham Basu (Bose),1.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre and disappointing..,Got this for my kid. Battery drains in a few hours. Last night after full charge it showed 7pc in 10 mins. App has a customer care number that doesnt work. It buttons for lodging compliant r useless.Pathetic...20 days later- After raising with the executive team the watch was replaced. The new one is working fine...so far..
Vinod Kaul,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor product which cannot be returned,The step numbers are very small. We are senior citizens and can only read it with a magnifying glass. The connection with mobile doesn't always work smoothly. The hand flip to light the face doesn't always work. Amazon refused to take it back and only offered replacement which is no good for us.
Deepti Gogia,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute waste of money and time,"Terrible experience! The watch doesn't stay connected at all the timesOne gets no notificationsEverytime you have to login to the app, to connect and there also it takes over 3-5 mins to connectThe watch is right next to the phone, and the mesagae displayed is that device not in range,Pls don't but an waste your time and moneyAmazon was kind and extremely helpful in arranging a super quick replacements(less than 24hrs) but the replacement watch was equally terrible"
Ankit Sharma,3.0 out of 5 stars,Purchase if can compromise the functionality,"Experience after 1 month use:-Got this for 2000-Looks good and was easy to connect at the starting.-sleep tracker, SPO2, other metrics capture were quite accurate.After using for 2 weeks:- Plenty of false notifications for calls.- Doesn't wakes on time often while checking the time..- Disconnects from the app and switch off on its own..I don't know what's the problem, but it's frequently getting disconnected from the phone.So, will be claiming the warranty.I start to like the experience of this watch, but then it gets disconnected so can't reccommend for anything.."
Santhosh K,1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my money üò≠ every worst product üò¢,"Worst product I'm not using it, becauseüòî- Main issue is connectivity, everytime it will disconnects.- Automatically it should connect to mobile that is not yet all working.- Mi Smart Band is much better then compare to this.- Even I don't about ""Colour fit 3"" how worst it is."
Anurag Phadnis,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent watch,"Screen size is okay not too big not too small, serves the purpose of watch and tracks pulse rate and blood oxygen, would be better if it also tracked body temperature.Battery life is easily over 1 week, notifications from mobile like SMS and calls are shown on watch which is good thing, but notifications from other apps like whatsapp are not shown on watch, that's okay though.One thing which is missing is support for hindi fonts, all my SMS in hindi are not being parsed by watch, it needs hindi fonts and fonts in other local langauges.It would be better if this was made in India, but currently it is made in china."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,A good buy. Worth the price.,"For someone looking to buy a SMARTWATCH at a less price and with good features please read my review. It has been one month of daily use and have had no complaints till now. Although I did face some issues syncing the phone and the watch in the initial few days. But a few restarts did the job. All the features work fine. I have also noticed that whenever there is a delayed alert on the watch it is mostly due to network issues or if the phone is away from the watch. The watch is not to be blamed. At times, I get notifications a sec earlier than the phone. The feature of replying back to calls with template msgs is only available in noise watches I think. I also have a Boat xtend and it only has the feature to reject calls.The green colour is actually a dull green colour so unless you are sure about the colour don't buy a green one since you won't have an option to return it only bcos u don't like the colour. However, A FEEDBACK FOR THE MAKERS - THERE IS NO REASON WHY NOISE PULSE should HAVE LESS WATCHFACES THAN YOUR OTHER MODELS. Update your user manual and make it easier for those who are using a SMARTWATCH for the first time. Your user manual does not state anything about how to sync it with the phone to get notifications etc. One has to figure it out on the app with trail and error method. It took me a whole day to sync the phone with the watch and figure out what was going wrong.In the end, No electronic gadget is perfect. If you are looking for something near perfect then buy an Apple watch. Else Noise pulse and similar other models are certainly a good buy."
Incognito ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price,"It‚Äôs a good product for the price. I‚Äôm facing one issue though. Every time I get a call on my mobile even after answering the call, watch keeps displaying a Chinese Call Code . Photo attached. This alert keeps displaying on watch and keeps vibrating till I touch cancel on watch. Has anyone faced this issue as it‚Äôs quite irritating"
Straight talk,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth buying,Takes hours to connect with application.Wrong stats. It shows steps at random. I walked 4000 steps & application showed 5000. And summary missed few days. Cheap product. Other parameters don't work.I asked for return yesterday. They agreed. Today Amazon played a game and says return window was closed yesterday. Shame
Abhishek,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not much functionality and not worth the price...,The app and interface is very poor and needs to be updated. Also the watch faces are very limited and not that good. MI and other brands have better products with much more value for that price point... Please don't purchase products from Noise as they don't offer value and also their products are sub standard in terms of functionality and user experience. Only thing they are relying on are sponsored ads. I feel they don't update an old product that much as well. Also their advertising is very misleading and does not have much in depth details of the product.
Ravi Shankar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product.. don't buy,Worst product .. it doesn't connect with Mobile properly and doesn't update your tracks... My husband bought another watch from same company in which they told it will have gps tracking but from day 1 it isn't working.... We raised a complaint and they took for repair even though the problem exists.. god knows what they have repaired...This is the first ever feedback I am giving ... This product disappointed me in such a way that I am taking time to write all this...
Sd Akram,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic experience,Guys trust me if you want to buy a toy for just hang in your hand then you can go with this watch other wise chose somthing eals bht bkwas watch hai guys replace krne ke bad b samne problem it means sare watch same hai so please don't go with this product just chose somthing eals all what you can do with this watch is just can check time properly other option are just there for showoff
R,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Waste of money, inaccurate readings",Waste of money. Step counts completely inaccurate. Added around 5000-6000 when travelling by car for 50km. Honor band has more features and is accurate. Sleep tracking on this product does not give the indepth analysis that honor band does. In fact the yesterday I removed the noise band and slept today it show I slept 8.5 hours??? Don't know if it was measuring my bed's sleep but if definitely wasn't mine. Obviously it doesn't work.
sai krishna,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth connectivity problem,"The watch is good but everytime the Bluetooth gets disconnect I need to go to the app everytime for connecting, beside this everything is good. I hope this problem gets resolved as early as possible. The updated version is more worst the app does not even open it goes on buffering for a long time even if the internet connectivity is strong...app functioning is not at all good and the major thing is the Bluetooth connectivity problem.... please try to solve this issue ASAP.."
jayaraj k,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good one but not sure noise compromised on quality,After I purchased device was functioning smoothly for a month and one day suddenly started to flash the screen automatically. Thought might be some jinx. Hence kept for full charge and completely reset the device. It started working for couple of hours as normal then again same issue. Once started pair the device with my mobile then watch display simply flashes. Tried pairing with different mobile too. Same result. Noise had scheduled a return pickup for service and repaired and sent back. But it started same issue again after couple of hours.It might be one of rare cases but servicing took almost more than 15 days first time and returned for second time and yet waiting for the device.I have been using noise product from quite time now. Only this device I faced loft of issues.Thank you
Prashant Sarathe,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product quality is third class and the app through which it is controlled is ""Tatti""",It is not worthy of 2799/-.....its battery back is just 1 day and as soon as battery level drop to around 85% it stops showing even the time and the screen looks like tv with burnt picture tube.And the worst thing is its noise fit app which will ask you to update it again n again.bluetooth connectivity is very poor..always asking for synchronise the watch. Not a product with this much price...it is worthy of 1000/- rs watch only.Don' buy it...go for a expensive one.
Sushil V Panchal,2.0 out of 5 stars,Do not meet expectations...üëé,Product looks nice but not worth it.. I have used MI band since 4 years and would like to see similar features with noisefit in terms of steps accuracy and sleep accuracy but highly disaaponted..1) app needs to sync manually to record steps2) sleep monitor doesn't look accurate.3) heart rate count doent work if turned off automatically (this drains down battery fast)4) device gets disconnect from app frequently.5) Overall AI is okay not so great.Recommendation -Instead of buying NoiseFit watch buy Mi band 4 or 5 of same range..
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very basic for its price.,"It's features are limited. It does the basic function of tracking steps and heart beats etc. But it doesn't differentiate between walking and running. Doesn't automatically detect cycling. These are features which google fit automatically detects. Syncing with phone is a little buggy. At times, if the phone syncs with the device at say, it is 10am, all the steps taken prior to that are erased. Can be better."
PRASHANT K.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dial is gud but strip is cheap material,Dial looking fabulous but strip is not orignal . looking cheap material . In sunshine beightnesss is good led is also gud. everything is better except strip is low quality. overall watch is nice to buy.
Johnson Global,1.0 out of 5 stars,AVOID - highly inaccurate and fake data being displayed.,"review after one month of use. Noisefit health app on android is light years behind the competition. App does not uninstall and takes days to install. Sleep data is highly inaccurate . Records sleep when awake and activity when sleeping. Syncing is a pain and requires phone and watch reboot which is painfully slow.Customer service is pathetic. Its a useless cheap toy with no brand, product nor service credibility."
Bhaswati Debnath,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced for the features provided,"Firstly look-wise it is great. But featurewise its just average. It has a good touch screen, provides exercise tracking, sleep tracking, alarm, heart rate monitor etc. These features are also available in many other less costlier watches. There is no call support, sms support nor camera. You can get an alert when you recieve a call but only to decline it there is no option to recieve the call. Similarly for sms you can view the sms but cannot reply. There is a remote music player feature which I could not get to work. So I would say it is an average buy for this price."
Anmol Hon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Think twice before buying,I bought this watch on 28th April 2021 and it's display stopped working on 18th may 2021. It's interface is not that much catchy . I am not satisfied with the product.When I launched complained online about my display problem . They picked it and send it back to me after a week . But when received I found that my problem is as it is. Now launching complaint again. I am using Boat Smartwach MI smart band 4 from last few years so I know how to smart watch. Now I am really facing frustration about watch.
Niranjan Rao,5.0 out of 5 stars,Looks cool and attractive,"It's a very nice watch, looks cool. The white gray color is decent and stylish. Touch is a bit slow. Takes sometime to get used to the interface. Vibrations are very good.App shows proper information. Steps accuracy depends upon your stride setup, once set correctly, it works nicely. Heart rate readings seems decent, not sure of the accuracy.Bought it for wife as Diwali gift and she loves it."
ajith,1.0 out of 5 stars,Malfunctioning  of battery,"At first product was not working fine I make a refund of it, but as of now the product has not yet received and I has received different one so again I has retuned it waste company...Don't buy this"
Somprakash D.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice watch...but as per the price range it can be better,I have bought a pair of the watches and these are good. But I have found few technical loopholes i guess.Pros:1.Nice watch at a glance as per the look at list.2.You can detach the belts.3. Charging is fast. It take approximately an hour to complete 100 % of the charging of battery.4. Battery back up is nice too. If the battery is full then it can last for not less then 4-5 days at a stretch on a rough schedule.5. Touch screen is okay.Cons:1. The Bluetooth of the device is not stable i.e. connection distorts.2. Sleep tracking is not up to the mark.3. The screen output is a bit small then it looks.4. As per the price range the watch can be more sophisticated with its mobile app.
Aejaz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Display error,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†After buy 3month , showing line on display ....I have done complaint 2 time but they ignore every time.Don't buy ."
Aditya Sagar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome and a Must Buy,"So I got it a week ago and after using it for a week, I decided the write a review. So, this Watch is working perfectly for me except for some things here and to here. The touch screen is also good. The Touch screen will respond 9/10 times. The pedometer is giving accurate steps also. The Sleep monitor is just perfect. It‚Äôs giving the exact time when I go to sleep and wake up. All the other features are also good. But the find my phone feature only works when the phone is unlocked and the NoiseFit app is open. The only 2 concerns that I have are the low battery life and limited watchfaces. It guarantees a 10 day battery life but my battery is draining quickly, maybe because of the excessive use I‚Äôm doing. Overall the watch is really good and a must buy. I am loving. You should really buy this watch.Edit: A new update just dropped today for the watch in which you can put wallpapers for you watch. It‚Äôs awesome. So no more limited watchfaces."
Unmesh Dalvi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good product. Could be more better.,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†I brought this product for tracking my distance i walk and run on daily basis. Cost me 1999‚ÇπWorked well for couple of days in beginning. Thereafter it had some issues.1.During running in sport mode the watch used to pause automatically in between without any idea.. so i have to check again and again. Or else it indicates less distance then i actually covered.2. Watch started rebooting again and again which erases data and thus bring every count to zero (ref video). Which is frustrating.3. We have to connect to noise mobile app which is easy to connect. But as you go 3-5 mtr away it disconnects so find my phone option becomes useless. Talking about application it is really slow.4. You get about 60 watch faces in mobile app but every time you upload new face to watch which takes 30+ sec to update.. the old one does not get stored in watch so again if you need the old one we have to go back to application to search and change.5. The watch does not lit up quickly by motion sensor, it takes few attempts to lit if the screen. Or other option is buttonGood thing about it is touch which is smooth easy interface. Probably good battery life as i used it of 5 days in one charge still has 45% approx. Light weight. Display quality is also good. Visible in sunlight also.I have asked for replacement, as it has some issues. Will get back soon with updated review. Thank you!"
Neeraj,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst watch... Buy realme instead...,"Hello,Just wanna say don't buy this watch.... In 3 days i have replaced this watch and still i m facing the same issue of notification not receiving.... The watch does not show any notification that are coming on phone... Tried resetting the watch phone app everything but no use.... I would recommend each one of you that please don't buy this product.... Also, the worst part is they don't have return policy....True feedback..."
Pankaj Nagrale,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wrong info provided,"I purchased this product so that i can use it as a watch as well as smartband. It says, cloud watch faces supported but it only has 5-6 default watch faces and you can't get any other watch face. That's wrong information given. I will take it with Amazon to remove this info from product.Customer care won't reply to any query. After sale service is pathetic. Don't buy."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product to purchase. After sale service is annoying.,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Worst product and worst customer care support. My watch is under warranty period however customer care isn‚Äôt interested to resolve my issue. I raised complaint and they marked it close without solving it. My recommendation is big no for the product. Product is not at all worth it.
Your Well-wisher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Too good to be true... exceptional performance,"The watch is totally amazing, considering the price range. I never expected this to be so good. and since the last update, we received on the android application, now a user can have its own customized watch face as well. I have been using this watch for almost 10 months for now and have faced no issues whatsoever, the battery remains for almost 15-20 days with no sweat at all and the charge time is exceptionally good, somewhat around 2.15 hrs."
Suresh babu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice watch with many cool features and Value for money!,"For the price range, this watch gives most values and many features.. will recommend for its minimalistic design and reliability..Pros:1. Lots of nice tracking features like steps, calories burnt, sleep, heart rate etc most of it is accurate and as per product description.. personally I like the music player app, breathe and heart rate monitor feature.. Also can raise a alert sound in your mobile in case if you want to find your missing mobile in same room space...2. Mobile app available, easy to setup and sync with watch. More customisation options available for watch faces, app notifications etc3. Battery life is too good, with normal usage can lost for a week.4. Alerts works fine with little delay of 3 to 5 seconds for calls, sms, whatsapp msgs, Instagram alerts, alarms etc can be customisable via app5. Different sports mode available to track your activities6. Clarity of screen is nice and the photos set as watch face is displayed very nicely..Cons:1. Build quality of watch is good for the price and looks premium but the screen gets minor scratches easily on daily use..2. Though sms notifications shows full content, whatsapp notifications doesn‚Äôt show any of the message content... would be very useful in case of reading whatsapp text messages...3. There is a lag of 3-5 seconds sometimes while accessing the watch.."
Vineet V,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noise ColorFit Pro 2,"I like Noise ColorFit Pro 2 fitness smart watch. Screen display is 1.3 inch colour display looks super cool. Design is very good. Its very light and easy for daily use. Track your step counts, distance, heart rate and sleep hours and milestones . Set up your notifications and alerts for whatsapp, facebook, gmail, messages and other apps. Monitor your hear rate, IP68 waterproof, battery backup is very good - 15-20 days approx depending upon you usage. Overall i like this smartwatch very much. Decent price, would definitely recommend my friends and family to buy this Fitness smartwatch."
Vineet Rana,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice non GPS smart watch with this budget,"Pros:1) The smart watch is awesome with price tag.2) Touch screen is smooth.3) Bluetooth connectivity is also nice.4) Battery backup is also good, after using for 4 months I found that it goes upto 9 days after charging 100%.5) Looks are killer.Cons:1) You cant track your live sports activity like running, walking with battery 15%.2) If you are seriously looking for tracking your runs in kilometers then this watch is not for you. There is difference i noticed when compared with my GPS enabled app ""Adidas Running"". I have uploaded screenshot of both. Above one is of ""Adidas Running"" app screen and below one us of noise app. For GPS there are other variant in the range of 4k+."
srutilekha d.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I received defective and different product,"Placed order for Noise colorfit Pro 2 oxy, amazon changed the order somehow and now it shows Noise colorfit pro 2. The product causes severe irritation on skin. Cannot be used for longer hours. As it was gift for my dad, he was not asking to replace ans change it and tried to use it for more than 7 days thinking it would stop causing irritation. But it's still the same and Amazon wouldn't accept their initial mistake neither replace the product. No help from Noise as well."
Krithika,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst ever smart watch! WASTE OF MONEY!,"I have bought this smartwatch on Aug 12th. Sep 11th it stopped syncing any of my activity to the mobile application. Mobile app was upto date. Walking running activities tracking was really worst. If I run 5kms it show 3.2km. I raised complaint to service portal for non sync issue, they referred me to FAQ page to troubleshoot myself. Not even a month since I bought this product. It is the worst ever I have seen. Ignore this product for heaven sake."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is defective, won't sync to the app on my android phone","Purchased the NoiseFit Pulse watch but it displays the QR code when you start it. you are allowed to clock next. this is where it displays that the bluetooth is ON. You are expected to download the NoiseFit app from google play store by scanning the QR code. It does not work. Even if you access G playstore, there are 4 apps. NoiseFit Sport, NoiseFit Track, NoiseFit assist - none of them will pair to the device via bluetooth.You can NOT use the device if it does not sync to the app. App does not work and so the Device does not Work. such a waste of Money."
Aniruddh,5.0 out of 5 stars,A good product in this price segment,"Liked the prod on a whole. It has all that it says. You cannot expect all the features that you find on a wear OS device like the ones come with 10k + price tag. But this pretty serves the purpose. You get most of the notifications, though you cannot reply to them. You can see the caller's name , though you cannot answer the call, you can only reject.The best thing I saw in this is you can add any watch face of your choice, i.e. select any photo from your phone gallery and that can be put as your watch wallpaper"
Ankita agrawal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy dis product ‚Äúdissapointing‚Äù,"There should be zero star also bcoz d product deserves it , the product has nothing what it says off ,i m sitting n just bcoz i hv set the bike mode it is showing the no. Of calories burned while one bikes on an average as you can see in the above image. its just fooling the customers, for dis you call it a SMART watch , it does nothing wat it says, looking at d features mentioned i recommended it to my frn but now my frn would never trust me on any product HUGE DISSAPPOINTMENT , total money waste."
Amandeep,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not so satifactory , but Average","i bought dis in Rs3499 . and it is not so good in working , but in 3.5k how much we could expct . I feel it should b in 2500 . i havn't used apple watch , and it looks like an apple watch so i bought dis . Only function i find useful in this watch is that i recive call or msg notifcation on this . thats it . You should buy this , only if you are unable to buy apple watch , and it look alike"
Rajesh pabari,2.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid as far as possible,"Many things to dislikeTouch screen could be much more responsive.Notification sync is not upto the mark.Battery lasts less than a week with very less usage in terms of notifications only on for calls, nothing else."
Govindaraj,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"I ordered the product with lot of expectations by seeing the configurations. But very much disappointed after 1 month of usage. The touch is not responsive and frequently not getting paired with the phone. Every time I unbind and bind again to get the data from the watch. The watch faces are also very limited and not getting any updates so for. Many times, the call alert is not getting stopped even after attending the call. It is sitting idle and not using it most of the time because of the above issues."
deepak d.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy,,,,, Worst product","Received the product by 21st Oct 2020, 1st the watch doesn't boot,after many times got started and touch wasn't working for some time, then again it started working and gone again, touch response was really late ,bluetooth won't connect at first then after rebooting my mobile 3 times BT won't connect, then suddenly BT started working again and after sometimes disconnects automatically, really bad product, not to mention the app , another bad one. Have already asked for refund but they accepted only for replacement , hope the new watch will be good enough to use."
Bibin baby,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, need version updation","Good product, waiting for version updationDear team, I didn't feel any changes in the recent updation, so I think it's better i can do the rating with all 5 stars after getting the satisfied updationSee*)Still its showing the same notification everytime until unless we are clossing the notification manually*) Camera controll isn't there yet*) Watch faces also still seems to be like the samr*) Find my phone option id there,And it is working with the same mobile Media volume,How its possible to find the phone when media volume is down.? Or someone kept our phone silent...?There should be a specific tone with fixed volume, like MI band providing ( experience from friend) and i feel its good..Apart from these major problems its nice to useSeriously iam happy with this product, and im expecting updations with good changes"
Tanish,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not satisfied,I dislike the product becoz 1. When I ordered the watch first in that face watch was not working I raised the complaint and returned it on next day 2. I ordered it on 28th it was 2999/- but got it on 1st march but on 1st it is 2499/- when I requested about the price they didn't help as I got the replacement on 2nd of march it also had a problem of face watch when called the concerned department they told it wl rectified in 1or 2 days.I felt very bad because it was a birthday gift to my son.
Hari Madhav,1.0 out of 5 stars,Performance is Poor,"The connectivity of smartwatch with smartphone is very poor. Once watch got disconnected from smartphone, we need to restart our phone to reconnect otherwise it will not connect. This process is very hectic. Another problem is that we have to on the mobile data, bluetooth, and location of the smartphone continuously to remain connected with the smartwatch while many other brands allows us to off mobile data and location but their smartwatch work properly. Therefore in my opinion, the purchase is waste of money. I strongly dislike the product."
Radhika saxena ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall great experience and value for money.,"LIKE :1. Notification alerts (sms, what's app,FB etc)2. Sports mode like walking, cycling etc is superb...3. heart rate monitoring and sleep pattern monitoring is useful.4. Looks of Watch is great.5. Inactivity alert is useful.Dislike :1. Notification alert gets inactive of its own which requires activation thru mob app again. This happens regularly even though blue tooth is on.2. Not able to read what's app msges which comes in group what's app. Only alert comes in group messages. Only msges sent by individual can be read fully.Rajeev"
Sasi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"worst performance, worth only as a digital wathc","Owning this product for a good amount of time, performance of the features is bad, customer service is also poor.Raised concern about the performance and i got only automated emails and when you reply with the alternate contacts they again send automated email. worst support.when you try to use the fitness app like cycling or others it will automatically disconnects and stopssync with mobile device is also very poor, when you not wearing the watch and keep it ideal in place, it tracks it as a sleep and records the content ,Overall not worth using the watch."
V. Srinath,1.0 out of 5 stars,100% Waste of money. NoiseFit is full of bugs and won't do anything except Restarting & Crashing,The watch'es build quality is fine considering the price which is paid during the sale and everything else is simply a waste of money. User will jump in front of a train (Pun Intended) after trying to update the firmware and will definitely Jump if they want to change the watchface or Sync data with phone.Overall Noise App literrally kills the whole experience and the devices doesn't work on any other app except Noise's.Extremely disappointed100% Waste of money!!BUY A LOCAL WATCH WHICH ATLEAST LOOKS GOOD RATHER THAN BUYING THIS JUNK!
Santosh kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a great product,I thought that this will be a great product and bought with great expectations. This is a huge dud from the company. The only positive I found is the build of the smartwatch.Cons:1. Low quality UI2. Not so great user-friendly Noisefit app3. Response time is very slow on the smartwatch
Vivek Kataria,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are all refurbished items , don't buy it.","I ordered this watch again after 2 month of first purchase. I ordered for my cousin at my address. Packing was torned, watch step always generate jerking sound when put it on wrist or remove. This watch accuracy is very pathetic, like steps, calories, distance all it calculated by its on choices. It has some inherent calibration issues. Frnds don't buy it. Furthermore traffic on Amazon.in web/app was so high when I tried to return it and in the mean time return window was closed by Amazon. One more observation that Amazon app/web does allow return clothing, apparels etc but not electronics items like this."
MARY,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wouldn't suggest to buy.,"The accuracy part and connectivity has lots of issue the bluetooth takes ages to connect, no contact number available just shows create ticket for complaint it looks good but when it's taking so much time to sync and much longer time to give accuracy disconnects on its own ...Just disappointed with the way h and didn't expect it to be soo bad."

suraj shukla,4.0 out of 5 stars,You can go for this its like paisavasool.üôÇ,"It is very good and gives a feel of Apple smartwatch but I will like to see some more improvement:-1- The lift wrist screen timing is slow and sometime doesn't work.2- The megnet who supports charger came out at very first week I had to fix that with myself only.3- The dial screen wallpapers are very less its just 6 or 7. Need to provide more cloud wallpaper by App.4- When I baught this, its notification system of call and massages were work only when I kept open Noisfit app in recent app bar if I close app the watch didn't give me any notification. I had to call Noise customer care and then it started work properly.Overall now this time I will say its working well and gives a cool look on hand."
Sudarshan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst battery, don't buy","Battery backup is nowhere near to the claimed 8 or10 days. With moderate usage it lasted only for two days. Unfortunately no option to return and refund, so money is gone... Not at all happy with the product"

Please refrain from buying this and wasting your money.. There are cheaper products on Amazon which works better than this"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Step and distance count resets randomly,"It's merely a glorified watch. The step count randomly resets, which defeats the purpose of the tracker and is a major irritant to see when after you have just completed a long run or workout. The issue was also there in the first watch I ordered which the company replaced (note they have no option for refund) but the issue persists in the replacement watch as well.I would definitely not recommend buying this watch. I myself have gone back to using my mi band for exercise and workout tracking and use this mostly as a watch (on the rare occasions when I use it)."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product. I loved it... In dial you can choose your family photos,1. Excellent product. I loved it... In dial you can choose your family photos.2.

Sarvesh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Have been using it from past 10days my experience so far is good overall.,Pros-1.A great mobile app.. Specially the challenges on it motivates you to go that extra mile..2.A great battery life company claims 10days but believe I charged it 100% on the first day it's been ten days so far and still it's 35% remaining.3.Touch is smooth as butter..4.Strips are really good and being light weight you don't even feel that you are wearing something.Cons-1.Alaram was a issues for I kept it at 6.30am and it started vibrating at 7.00am and next day it was 7.15am..2.sleep tracking have been not working from past 2 to 3days...due to which I am seriously annoyed..I have updated the app. It's been connect to the app through the Bluetooth and the internet. 24hrs.but still the problems continue...Please provide me a solution..
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Below Average Product,"The touch and feel of product is good but the notification is really sad, and the frequent disconnecting issue is too much, there is no alert of device getting disconnected even if it is in the vicinity of the phone and re connecting takes a lot of time. Annoying to have features which actually dont work, could have simply done away with these features."
Abhishek Kohli,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Worst calorie and distance tracking device! Almost inaccurate every time. Sweat goes between skin and watch and shows errors in readings during exercise even if the watch is tightly adjusted to your wrist. It does not count the distance if you are moving in your house at a specific place or while you are on treadmill. Even, it shows no activity signal during intense workout and stops in between before completion of exercise. Touchscreen is not good but that is to be expected at this price range. I bought it mainly for my calorie tracking routine but it was a big disappointment. Its not even waterproof, when it comes in contact with water it starts malfunctioning, for eg : giving wrong distance and calorie readings when i was cycling in rain ( so the IP68 in this watch is complete failure). It is the worst experience for me especially compared to my Samsung Galaxy Watch 3.I RECOMMENED NOT TO BUY THIS FAILURE PRODUCT FROM NOISE."

Bhavik,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth investing....,"Not worth buying as only after two months of purchase the product Has stopped performing.The sports mode has stopped displaying,moreover the accuracy is also not at all accurate. The actual distance run and the distance displayed has a difference of 20% which is alarming.Moreover the price is tooo high the worth.Not recommend for real health freaks....price is too high should be around 1000-1050."
Sachin Awate,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst product, Don't buy this product","Worst product, don't but this product.I made a purchase Noise Color Fit Pulse Smartwatch of Rs.1,999.00 on 17th Nov 2021 and it‚Äôs order number is 407-2787873-4365910 from Amazon. From day one the watch was having connectivity issue as a result I was unable to get any alerts and notifications on my watch. Every single time the watch used to get disconnect, I had to reset it to pair it again with my android mobile. To get it resolved I handed over the product on 11th Dec 2021 to the nearby Service Centre which is located at Andheri West. On 20th Dec 2021, I got the confirmation that the product is ready and the complaint has been resolved.The product worked properly for next two days but on the third day the product came with another issue. It started getting switched off for no reasons at any time. Even if the battery is full, it just suddenly used to get switched off. So I submitted the product to the same service centre again on 30th Dec 2021.And this time they handed it over to me after some 3-4 days but I‚Äôm not at all satisfied because the product is still having the same issue. It suddenly gets disconnect even if the battery is decent. I‚Äôm pretty sure they just did some cleaning and handed it over to me second time. Not sure what kind of services they are providing because it‚Äôs the second time I submitted the product but yet the issue is not resolved!."
Bhaumil Shah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Product with great features.,"The look is very premium, though it is made up of polycarbonate, it has curved display just like Apple Watch.Notification for most of the application are received on the Watch, even call notification is displayed.There is a limitation to watch faces, but available watch faces are good enough.Battery life is of approximately 7 to 10 days as per my usage."
Binish,5.0 out of 5 stars,A fantastic watch with needed features,I have been using this for a couple of months now and it has been a great experience until now.

Even we can read the messages from the watch itslef. On the whole a superb product

And only the background can be changed, nothing else like time font style or colour.You cannot reply to messages or answer calls from the devise. Because it‚Äôs NOT a smartwatch.To set an alarm also, you need to use the app from your cellphone. Alarm cannot be set from the watch directly.Wrist sense is not THAT great... 3/5Overall.. if u want to use as an activity tracer, with watch face customisation, then it‚Äôs a good product. 4/5"
Mayur,4.0 out of 5 stars,Please read before you buy!,"Noise Colourfit pulse watch is great in terms of hardware, screen touch, and overall design. the sensor data acquisition is quite accurate. overall product is nice and perfectly priced.The Noise app, when it comes to app connectivity and Syncing with the watch many are facing issues regarding connection lost, connected but not syncing to receive calls or messages or sometimes not connecting at all after firmware update, etc. but its a software issue where I think noise can fix it with updates.conclusion: Greate at hardware and functionality, but needs a bug-free app to deliver an even better experience."

Rajesh Pandey,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy this product, its a waste of money!","More than the product quality, this time Amazon after sales service disappointed me.Pathetic quality product, not even worth 1000 rupees.Its highly overpriced & is not as advertised. The heart rate does not work, its very slow & the touch does not even respond most of the time.There are glitches in the watch I received it gets switch off while checking heart rate.Also I got absolute absurd feedback from the customer care earlier they said that replacement can be done from different address but now they denied for the same and speaking.Do not buy this product, its a waste of money!"
Swati,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Product,"Worst Product. The advertisement shows something else, actual watch is diffrent. The display is pathetic so as touch. Just like any other chinese watch"
Mayur Raut,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,Guys. believe me. i have purchase it for 1999rs in recent sale and i got defective watch. I got replacement and i felt of returning it as it is of very low quality. Cheap belt and looks like china ka maal. Dont waste your money. Its not even of 500 bucks. total waste.. amazon should ban such cheap products.. any how i got my money refunded
Alpesh L.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad Buy.... Don't buy it,A very bad buy... Incorrect step and distance counts... Not sure if other things are calculated accurately... Had faced a lot of problems in getting call notifications started on the watch... Service center guys took the watch from me after a compliant saying they will replace it and then gave me the same piece again... No watch faces available now... Bought it in October 2020 and had to register 1 complaint every 30 to 40 days for some or the other issues
Sambhav j.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Check out before buying,"First of all let me come to watch if you use the watch to its fullest it can work for more than 10 days,which is pretty impressive the touch is very smooth and believe me you will love the fact that the lag in watch is almost a no. Just go for it.The major problem is with the app.Whenever you update the app all the login details will be erased and you need to set it up again. Whenever you update your watchface it takes more than 3 min to transfer it and many times its a failiure. One more down side is that you can only store one watchface at a time. That is out of five 4 are primary watch faces which can't be changed. Thanks for reading it."
Nagarjuna Yadav K,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worrest Product,nt even calculate your steps and heart beat too","I bought this product by looking the design..but later i cime to know this is not at all worth.its not at all calculating your steps and heart beat too..worrest product really.i want to send it back , but unfortunately i didn't find any Refund policy for this worrest Watch.The only best thing is charging will be long lasting..and if you want a stylish one,you can go a head.."
rakesh soni,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst services from amazon,I hv called at least 9 times to Amazon customer care to pick my watch which is not working from day 1. Everytime there is an assurance that watched vl be picked up / replacement vl be organised. I cannot track this also. People r least bothered about customer satisfaction. Der r no escalation matrix as well. I hv bought new ome from amazon since this was talking time. Now my 3000 rs which i paid originally is at risk. No one is taking d ownership
Rakesh N.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not at all satisfactory product,Firstly its a made in china product which i came to know after a while when i was going through the manuals secondly its not an accurate product and the one that i received already seemed to be used as it was open and the watch straps had some marks in it. Moreover there was some measurements as well on the calories burnt and distance covered for days prior to my delivery
Piu,1.0 out of 5 stars,‚òπÔ∏è,"It's very bad experience with Noise colorfit pro 2 .As I used it for 5 days unable to track step,sleep and heartrate all its showing wrong .We can adjust if it's max 10% faulty at worst situation bcs we can't expect exact tracking on any device .

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor App,  Device doesnt work","i have been using this for 5 months now, not my first smart watch. Compared to the previous brand i used, the mobile app of noise is poor and very basic, doesnt give any intelligence cannot edit goals etc. The interface is poor.Also the watch doesnt work well, after 5mths, the wrist sense stopped working and since the start the watch doesnt give all activities option, once has to keep resetting the phone.To top it all the customer service in their app is lumpy.. would not recommend at any price."
NellaiRam,3.0 out of 5 stars,Rise to Wake feature not working as expected !,"It takes 2 to 3 attempts to awake the watch face by raising your hand to see the time.Spo2 Accuracy : GoodHear Rate Accuracy: GoodWatch Display Quality : Can be better, very few of the watch faces looks crisp rest of them looks so dull.Calorie Tracking Accuracy: I did a same type exercise for two consecutive days almost in the same pace, but there is drastic difference in the calorie burnt number."
Nitin Vyas,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not satisfied from watch or  amazon,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Not good....price too high..go for another one...and mist grey colour is not good for watches it faded in 5 days see in my photos...zero star
Sumit,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Product,One of the worst Product I have ever seen. This watch have frequent connections problem. In a day it gets disconnected multiple times. You have to pair it again and again which will erase all your data. Touch is not smooth enough. Notification response is not up to the mark. Even after receiving the call the watch keeps on vibrating. I had replaced this and the replacement also seems to have the same problem. Please think twice before buying.
Gunasheela,1.0 out of 5 stars,Watch is hanging its response is very very poor. Request for exchange rather than replacement.,It doesn't work properly and it is hanging a lot. Touch screen doesn't work. Mobile app is also not good. Sleep tracking is showing wrong. Step count is not good. Overall didn't like the product. Request for exchange rather than replacement. Not required for refund will exchange the product with other item of the same price.

Mithun,1.0 out of 5 stars,#DONT-BUY-NOISE-PRODUCTS,"This product is totally waste of money. I should not have gone for it. Even customer care is even worst in term of giving the solution for it. I hold 1 year product warranty and totally frustrated within 2 month‚Äôs. Wherein I registered multiple complained to customer care and even two time they took it for repair and return it with in 2-3 days as it is mentioning replacement. But in actual there is no replacement given.This watch takes auto reset automatically and I loose all activity data for the day. It happens frequently. Whole point of buying this product is to monitor my activity logs which I can‚Äôt do it with NOISE pulse.Sorry to mention, I will not be able to recommend NOISE as brand to go with, to my sports community and family.#DONT-BUY-NOISE-PRODUCTS"

Shudip,2.0 out of 5 stars,Average product,"Cons1. Not sure why watch disconnects from phone frequently.2. Touch is not that gr8, it is very average.3.

vinuth,2.0 out of 5 stars,Even 2 stars not worth,Not soo happy with the watch. Look wise it's OK but you don't have much option such where I have used MI fit band previously and in that I had good option in the menu and it was more user friendly. But this is not worth for the price
Rohan Pathak,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not satisfied with Product quality and interface !!,Not satisfied with Product quality as well interface ..!!

Sanit Dhakne,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product and a low grade service provider,This is Sanit Dhakne I have bought noise colorfit pro 2. I have never seen company like this before I have other company products also but your company is the worst then anyoneCalling you several times and not getting the issues solved for two weeks now.Bought a new watch and it's stopped working in just 4 months what a shame and not providing service also to the customer again and again I have to call your people. My issues are not solved nor I got any replacement. This is shame for your company don't make this kind of products and sell. I have called your customer executives so many times they are not able to solve my issues.
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless product. Waste of money,The product stopped working just less than 3 months after purchase. It doesn't charge at all. Also doesn't sync with Google fit or other apps. Totally disappointed and waste of money. The sleep tracker doesn't work. Even step tracker malfunctions. The touch screen works sometimes only. I cant find help for warranty (it says 1 year of warranty)
Rachel,3.0 out of 5 stars,Looks Deceive!!!,I'm not much into workouts. I just needed a good looking black watch and since we had great indian sale offers I bought this. This was the current best and latest option available on Amazon.Looks and build: The build quality is horrible. I have so many 500 rupees watches with much better build. It has a square and no full screen. That being said when I customized the watch face I was surprised with the pixel resolved being good.Software: The touch response isn't great. The back option is awful to understand. The pedometer doesn't work right.Max this product should be sold at 1100 rupees. Not a paisa more. I wanna return and buy another better option but this only has replacement option.
Akhil.R,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality is very Good but Features are less,"It is a good watch in quality basis. But consists of only some basic features. It does not have camera, can't make calls or write messages, no sim or card slot etc. touch screen sensor is also average. I felt like it is little lagging too.But it is easy and comfort to wear. Looks like a premium watch. If you have only few requirements then you can select this watch."
Roshan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointing,The watch has stopped counting steps. It's only one month since I purchased the smartwatch. Touch screen is also slow to respond. I am absolutely disappointed. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
Atul Gupta,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless watch from Noise and even worst customer care!!,This is one useless good for nothing watch. Some of the features are not working even though claimed by company. On complaint they got the watch collected for checking and returned the watch after 4-5 days. However the problems remain the same. Poor product.. worst service.
sujit das,3.0 out of 5 stars,The strap gave my wrist rashes,"I was not expecting the product strap color to be a bright red color, and after wearing for a few days look what it did to my wrist ? It's just me or this is happening to others too"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Serving the Buying Purpose,"Do not buy this Product, My observations as below,* Look wise its very good and attractive.* Main reason for this review is that i bought this product for step count purpose. However it also counts the steps when I am travelling to Car or in any vehicle. This do not give the accurate count.* Touch is also not friendly.* Specially when you wants to see the time you have to make your hand in straight position and screen automatically blinks, however it takes too much time to this bend to sense the position of our hand and to saw us the time.Not recommended to buy."
Stark,4.0 out of 5 stars,A good product!,"It's a good product at the price it's offered. The accuracy in step-tracking is almost perfect, though it could've been better. The touch screen isn't as sensitive as your phone screen, but it does the job. I would've been happier if it gave me an option of customising the watch face, which at the moment is limited to the ones which are pre-loaded. Overall, the product does what it boasts of at an affordable price. Kudos! : )"
ABHINAV BHARDWAJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent product,Product is decent and useful but after sales feedback collection of Noise is really a pain. Even when i said i am not comfortable with follow up on whatsapp the executive is pushing me to do it. Its time to think is this thing worth to buy comparing the follow up being done for feedback.
Priyadarshni A U,4.0 out of 5 stars,Watch Review,"1. This watch is good in calculating the steps. And walking mode and other sports modes are good. But I don't know how to calculate calories burned while doing aerobics, as there is no such mode to calculate.2. Oxygen level and pulse level can be calculated.3. Regarding call receive, as the device getting disconnected frequently we don't receive call in watch device.Device and phone gets disconnected frequently we have to restart our phone to pair device again automatically.Battery life of device is good"
Archana Menon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,"I have been using this product for 3 months This product is not worth the money . I had used an mi band before this and that was better than this . The watch is fine with the basic functions - can track sleep data, step count, calories . But the noise app is the main problem. Every time we update the app we have to pair /connect bind the watch with the app. Because of this I lost all the data of the past months. And the step count, calorie count gets reset inbetween the day due to no reason . This is extremely frustrating.Better watches in the market . This watch is not worth it ."

Avishek kumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice watch but have some cons also,"Good watch ...got for 2999 in sale but have some pros and cons alsopros - very good looking , screen is bright and of good quality like mobile screen , normal battery life 6 to 7 days normal usage , good touch and wrist response and greatly customisablecons - built quality is low , buttons and watch and strap may look premium but quilty is just ok also might not very accurate sonsors having accuracy approx 70 to 75 perc although at this price point it is a great pick if you want a smart watch which is good and budget freindly so overall 4 out of 5 .."
Surender rawat,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this product.,This is really pathetic that this so called smart watch stop working with in a period of 15 days only. And you people have given 1 year warranty for what. Even service center people don't know what was the reason of not working of this watch. Replacement period is only for 10 days and it was not working with in 15 day not even a month completed by this product. Hopeless.Please don't buy it.
Nabajit Ranjan Kalita,3.0 out of 5 stars,Boggas. No return. Beware of buying.,Activity tracker is not up to the mark.I have run 6 km but it is showing 5 km only.Evwry 100 mtrs there is a short count of 20 to 25 MTRs. Notifications are also come lately. I am not salisfied with the performance. Sleep racking is not working properly. After wake up if I keep the watch in a table it is showing sleeping again. Heart rate and others I have not tasted. At all I have not been convinced to any other elements of the watch.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worst for Iphone Users,"Giving 2 Starts only because of looks. NoiseFit Application for Apple users is worst. It doesn't fetch data for Weekly or monthly. It just shows for present day. There is no Exercise mode So if You are Working out it doesn't take into consideration. Even though it has option for Gmail and Outlook notification alert, It doesn't provide those."
YJ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product and pathetic customer service,"From the day I have bought this product till today (6months and counting) I am having the same problem ie not getting notification (WhatsApp, email etc) on the dial.

TDG,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad! very bad! battery life after few weeks,"Very bad battery life! After few weeks from 10 days to 3days, its battery hardly stays for 3days even I am not using it and disconnected from phone, and when using it properly it stays hardly 2days...I baught 2 watches, another one is just working fine.So basically they do not check quality. It's your luck...I suggest buy some reputed company's watch. I dont know where the service centre is. Good thing is that it's in warranty period."
Shagun Dhir,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy this.,"It's an average watch. Honestly whatever reason you're buying it for, you can get easy alternatives in the same price or maybe 500rs more. The major drawback is it doesn't sync with any other app and it's very veryyyyy annoying. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew that. And the step tracking is also not very accurate, sometimes adds steps while you're moving fast in a car too. Do not buy this."
chayan das,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money.,"Looks: The colour of the product is very nice. Looks also very good and looks very sophisticated.Quality: As of now quality is good and durable. I'm buying it for daily use.Apps: After switching on, an QR code will appear on the watch screen but I found quite difficult to install the app on my Samsung phone, so I downloaded it from play store. Previously it was quite difficult for me to operate it and settings was not perfectly user friendly. So I search it from YouTube and after daily using it I found easy as of now.After daily using, all app and notifier is working perfect and ok.Battery: It's giving 5day of battery life afte one full charge.Overall: Product is very nice and value for money."
Manoj Tapaswi,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Product I got from Noise,"As noise is reputed company in making or manufacturing smart watches and other wearables, so I bought a noise colorfit pulse watch few days back. Watch details shown on amazon and over there its clearly mentioned that its IP68 certified which means waterproof but it failed. While driving in drizzling rain watch got wet and stopped working.After that I waited for 2 3 days for watch will start again but it doen't started. Hence I registerd a complaint at their site for getting proper solution but nothing happend and my complaint directly closed rather my complaint ticket closed directly.So my siggestion to everyone before going to buy any Noise product think twice......"

sasanka Maity,1.0 out of 5 stars,"POOR BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY, WASTE OF MONEY","Connectivity is the most vital thing in this smartwatch. After using one week , I'm getting the following difficulties:1. Maximum time it disconnected from phone, and once it disconnected from phone it never be connected automatically.The cause behind the problem is Bluetooth working very poorly.2. App is working very badly. Even it cannot sink data from smartwatch automatically.So, I think there is nothing for worth buying."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Below average for the price,"I have used this and compared with one of the chip one and found chip one is much better in terms of look and feel, brightness, functions, tracking, reminders and what not.

vinod singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Alert!!,The product is worst as well as the customer service also .If there is a negative rating I will give then the lowest.I bought the watch in the month of Jan after 4-5 month it's stop working.I have complaint 2 times for warranty reclaime...but they make fool by doing call and diverting it to troubleshoot problems.Without knowing the customer or proper solution they just close the complain .I will never recommend anyone to get the product.
Yuthika Sinha,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy if wanna keep a track of sleep.,Its shows wrong readings. Plus if you sleep in the daytime it won't track it.

Sandesh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good battery life,"After using it for one week I can give this product a 4.5 stars for accuracy and durability.It counts exact steps, heart rate n blood oxygen.Sports mode is also a good for athletes this who wants to measure their goal quantitatively.Connctvity to Mobile is bit weak n get disconnected very easily hence msging n call alearts may miss.But since I hv bought it to track my physical activity it works better on that front hence desearves a good rating so 4.5"
ADESH ASHOKKUMAR SATHAVARA,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this product!!,"Don't buy this product!!I used it for 4 days down, the product automatically gets disconnected and they you will have to uninstall the Noise app which is essential to use this watch then reinstall, after reinstalling it doesn't allow you to connect to the smart watch this happens continuously, i tried turning off the watch and doing the entire process again but all in vain.... Absolute dissatisfaction"
Jui Shah,1.0 out of 5 stars,Steps and calories are counting while traveling in car / bus.,"I purchased this item and travelled within 3 days from purchase. I have set it up all. But when I was travelling in car, my step count was increased.. That's not convinced!!!. Also, based on steps increased even I haven't burnt my calories, that shows you reached your daily goal for calorie burn..ü§£üòíü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Abhijeet Singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Nit worth with all the troubles to trouble shoot as end user,Gets disconnected from the app time and again and u need to reinstall the app. They do not have a stable app. Which is too irritating and time consuming
Sunil Suryawanshi,1.0 out of 5 stars,"PLEASE DON'T BUY DIS PRODUCT, Its useless","It doesn't have oxymeter to check oxygen nor it checks you Blood pressure also i doesn't show you notifications about anything like WhatsApp, WeChat etc...although it lacks many features i don't get it y it is priced at Rs 3000..USELESS product...the biggest things is Noise didn't even keep refund policy on this trash product, you can only replace it...the only best thing abt dis product is its build quality...bt it is also of no use because we need features rather than show off bullshit watch by Noise"
Kumar kartikey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not expected,"The watch is pretty gud but... according to me 2500 rupess is not the right amount for it.It must be less then 1800 coz of the product battery backup is nice, tracking is also accurate but problem is that it seems that it would not be with uh for much tym..as I can't explain in my words but it would not be for more than 6 months I think... Weight is very light nd I loved it‚ù§Ô∏è just 30-60 grms. Also, here music control is given but it is not working still after many tryzz . Also I think the noice company is careless about selling it's product online coz I didn't received total things in the box marked. Watchface are less but you can set ur own photo or can dwnld photo from Google or anywhere and make ur Watchface nd I liked it‚ù§Ô∏èAfter all, I rated 3 out of 5 nd my suggestion is you must skip for realme,mi or huwaie..I'm not promoting üòÖ but they are brand so, u must go for it..."
Abhiram K H,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's waste of money.,"In my case the Bluetooth tethering never happens.Also the product is very lagging.I've replaced it once & tried again but it's the same story again.After all it's only noise(only cheap & heaps of marketing & boasting) by the brand about being number one in India.I think better go for chinese products.Anyway initiated refund, I will let you all know whether I get my money back or not.Also one more thing, I tried to review the product in Google Play(noisefit) app.but turns out, they've removed that app from playstore.some other apps of noise is available."
Moomin Shah (CA),3.0 out of 5 stars,Overall a Good Watch üëç,"If you are looking for an average smartwatch then noise colourfit Pro 2 is a good option . You get a lots of option like heart rate monitoring which is not that accurate and upto the expectations but not at all bad in the price you pay for watch , 24*7 activity tracking via dedicated app is a plus here but then come on not a fancy at all , sports mode check , fitness tracking check , sleep monitoring check , screen is a little less touch sensitive which is a minus , i have used the watch for more than two months now and yes all i can write is a good watch , battery life is üëç , like i literally go like a week on full charge with a heavy usage , so yes a good watch in overall . Is overpriced üëé"
Rahul,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad product üò°üò°üò°üò°,screen size too small no extra watch faces and also plastic body lookwise is not good ... Bad product ..
KESHAV SHARMA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Beautiful and Intelligent Watch,"Genuine Review of Noise Colorfit pro 2,Really very Good smartwatch, All functions working well....I genuinely used it day and night with all functions and it gives me 9 day battery backup with 7%remaining battery üëç...May be it run on 10 day too. very impressive.Looks and Quality also tremendous......The only I help from Noise is please open your service center in Jammu J&K and provide some watch case and tempered Glass to protect Watch.And last but not least AMAZON IS NO.1.Thanks and RegardsKeshav Sharma"
Sumeet MB,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a bit watch,"This product looks good. Call alert and notification is not working for me.Hopeless sleep tracking,I am using Mi 4 also. It is betlst in its accuracy.Customer service of noise fit keep suggeting us to reinstall their app for better functioning.Hopeless service and product"
Anand Kumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Watch very good but noise app not good because too much bug in this,After using 10 to 15 day Noise Watch is very good but most problem is no connectivity in applications some time connect after same time deconnect in noise app it's too much bugBattery capacity is very poor after Full charging maxmi backup 48h is very bad battery capacity in this watch and other things is good üôÇ
puran,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just don't call it smartwatch,"Sleep tracking and activities tracking is worst in the watch. It doesn't sense approximately time when you got sleep and when you woke up. When you start activity and stop once you complete, it doesn't show your completed activity and shows there no activity record for you.Though I got it at 1999 INR but I'm going to throw it away as it doesn't fulfil my purpose of purchase.If anyone can suggest any other fitness band or smartwatch that have good sleep monitoring. I was using MI4 and that was really good. It got damaged üò≠"
KUNAL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Fitness tracker,"I have been using this for fast few months, and found it pretty decent in tracking. One of the best in this price point. It has almost everything except SPo2 and GPS tracker, which i think would boost the price. Watch is light, display carries nearly all tracking details on the dial(For this you have to choose the proper watch face), not so bulky not so tiny, kind of average size and fit. Pretty pocket friendly decent watch."
Varun M.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unreliable and not worth the money,"It's hardly been a week or two since I bought the watch, and yet, it doesn't sync well with the mobile app, and it needs to be restarted and troubleshooted with various methods to make it work every now and then. And, this reflects on various features like the movement sensors to display the time without manually touching the watch, or even for the message and alert notifications that is activated to be displayed on the watch. Even syncing the watch with music also disconnects and needs to be reset or connect every other day to make it work. Irrespective of all these, Noise make sures that they push all the ads about their brand as fixed notification, and that sucks. Overall, very poor from a well established brand like Noise."
Rushith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality and functions.,"I was using Colorfut Pro 2 earlier.But after that when I started using Pulse, beleive me I can't imagine of having this type of quality and functions you would get in this range.I can use multiple watch face. The sports mode is also being lengthened (more features). The appearance is also awesome. Its just a Dhamaka and Paisa wasool package.Battery Life üîã is also durable."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noise colorfit pro 2 review,"I bought this watch a few months back. It is working perfectly and I have no problems with this. It's touch screen, sleep tracking, sports, alarm, etc are awesome. In many reviews I saw that they say that it is not working properly and blah blah..... Please do not agree with them. This is an awesome product. You should definitely buy this. Thanks to Amazon also that it delivered the proxy on the same day of ordering."
Rahul K,3.0 out of 5 stars,its okay for 3199,"bought it for 3199. the noisefit app takes up a minute to connect to the watch, quite irritating. also the app is in developing stage so we will have to be patient with it might take some months. the steps tracking is accurate for long haul walks and runs with out even taking your phone you can if you want to have very accurate data but without phone too works almost the same. for bike ride and workout mode or pretty much any other mode it sucks. sleep tracking is the worst so i use my mi hrx band for it. touch interface is a bit lagging sometimes. battery life is good as i don't use it that extensively. music play back and all other features works ONLY when you properly connect it via app just turning on the bluetooth won't work. i was able to see the display in bright sunlight too on medium brightness. overall feel and looks are excellent in 3199 price range."
Chetan Paradkar,2.0 out of 5 stars,Low quality even for the price!,Build quality- okTouch sense - poorMobile App- badData view - badBattery - barely 3 daysMy experience is poor with this watch ...the data representation is poor and the capturing process is bad... Touch screen is really worthless even for the price it quotes (2k)...Overall a bad experience for me.
Ujjawal Kumar Chorasia,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake company like who has no customer care services,Painful experience after its purchase as it went out of order just a week after its delivery to me and since then I have been facing such bad experience that company behaviour for committed customer service is just a formality where no one is to attend grievances for its resolution even after being raised several times through its app and e-mail mail. Startling facts came to the fore when I knew its sale is through Amazon as being a joint venture company with apario ( company name of noise fit/ colour fit). So Amazon can not shrugg off its responsibility if any legality arises for being apario ( nose fit) company fake.
SD,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible Product,It has a terrible compatibility with the app. After 2 days of configuration it's stops syncing. Not worth it at all. Other than using it as a pedometer and movement reminder nothing else works cause it doesn't sync even after multiple attempts.
Abhishek Gupta,1.0 out of 5 stars,All noise no substance... Fit for garbage,"Feedback after one month use-Pathetic watch. Takes ages to connect to phone, data disappears suddenly and resets itself.If you follow all instructions to keep their app running in background, it eats up your phone battery at an alarming speed.Multiple times my step count shows as zero but activity tracker shows full duration of activity. Looks like I walked for 45 mins without taking a step.Horrible experience. Don't buy."
Ayaz Pathan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product,"Guys this is A very genuine review, had gifted this product to my brother, but with in a week he observed one Black spot in the rightside of the display, company is claiming that product is water proof but i can say that this is a false claiming.Don't buy this product...Quality is also not that much good..."
Srinidhi,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product,It's patheticIt looks very cheap.My wrong for whatever the price could not expect anything moreDon't go by the photo it is very small compared to the photo looks like a kids watch
Balabi Nancy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Please go for little higher budget,"Watch is nice look for the budget amount. Only 8 watch faces available. You won't be able to find anyface on web also. Sleep cycle not working at all.. Screen is small compare to watch actual head. All other sensor working is some what ok.. There is no call taking option, only call end option available. If you really want a nice functional smart watch, then save little more and go for 5000 range.."
Satya Ganesh Babu Gajjarapu,3.0 out of 5 stars,Less Feature watch,"No spo2, oxygen levels can't be read. Only watch with time display, sleep monitor, distance measure walking and music control on this. Only call reject, no option to take call, or make silent or Mute. I advise to go for advanced ones even spending another Rs.1000 or so."
Sayantan Pathak,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not value for money.,Battery backup is good but the heart rate monitor is highly inaccurate. The looks are quite good. The display does not respond 2/8 times on touch.
Naresh thakur,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst,Not satisfied with noise product as much they have written about product.Battery life is not more than two days as they have written it works for 10 days. Slow charging too.Wallpapers not working properly change automatically.Sometimes touch not working.Smart notification are not working properly.Seems like old or used product delivered.Very bad product.
Ankit mishra,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy,Screen itni choti hy ki kuch dikhega hi nii üòÇüòÇ Request hy mat lena aur built quality kafi low hyy üòîüòî
Pooja,3.0 out of 5 stars,Skin rash after using,"This is ok product. I got skin rash after using it continues fir around 10 days. If u have sensitive skin please watch out, it might give you rash. It tracks everything ok, however I highly doubt their calories burning data."
Vaibhav Mache,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product,"Very less options which can be called as smartwatch.I later found out that in same price you can buy a watch 6 series smartwatch from flipkart ...which is with all options,Like calling, music player, etc...And top of that you cannot even return this item..."
Victor A.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Third class horrible!,It has been a disgusting purchase. The watch will just not sync rightly. The idle alert won‚Äôt ever get updated. The watch face option from their NoiseFit app will just not function.Overall this gets a zero star. Worst purchase ever!
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless,Useless productOrdered on 11 August 2021. Received on time on 16th. But it switched off while it was still showing 80% battery. So I put it on charge for 2hrs. Still not switching on. Noise is not accepting complaint registering request and couldnt able to claim warranty.
Be Unique,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with return and replace service.,I saw it was a big dial and not looking good in black so wanted to return but they don't have such option. They can just replace it with same one. Helpless iam. I added a comment while replacing to atleast change the color but they r sending the same one.
Nitish Parab,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unpairing Issue,The watch keeps getting unpaired every other day and I end up losing all data thanks to that. It's frankly very irritating. Also keeps getting disconnected from the watch for some reason and I've to make sure from that happening all the time. What's the point of owning a watch if I have to keep checking my phone to make sure it's functioning properly again and again.
Rachel Nile,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this product,I had baught this product in 2 months it stopped working and it is not charging. I also palced a complaint but there not revert from the noise team. I have mailed so many time they don't reply to any of it. Worst customer service. Worst products. Very bad experience. I request not to buy this product it is waste of money
Vineeth Komanpally,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Review after 6 Months, Good and need improvements.","Vibrative Alarm( setting through phone but not directly), Physical fitness tracker (Running, Walking, Cycling etc), Herat rate, Music and Voice call Control (can be declined but not answered), Accurate Time, Breathing exercise, Timer and Stopwatch, Easly connected to phone but phone battery drains, Watch charge lasting for more than week."
PRASHANTVC,1.0 out of 5 stars,The watch looks good but cant function properly.,The media could not be loaded. ¬†The product looks good. But cant sync the watch faces. I have raised two complaints which were closed out without resoling my complaints. They said that i cant raise duplicate cplaints but never provided any solution. Trust me guyes dont buy any watch from noise. I have bought two. But of worst quality.
Sathishkumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money...,I ordered the product with a lot of expectations.The first display quality is not good what I expected.The touch is very slow does not even respond most of the time.Vibrator its very slow is not so good like Mi Band.Some connecting problems to the phone.The product automatically gets disconnected sometimes.The most important note color fit 2 with the app not able on/off the email notification10 days battery is not a true maximum of 4 to 5 days.Mostly taking more time while syncing with a watch to app.
CJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent device...but not for IOS users !!,"Negatives:1. The NoiseFit IOS app is very slow and sluggish.2. The monthly step, sleep data is not captured at all.3. There are no proper updates for IOS app.4. The sleep tracker is not working after a app update and the support team is very slow to resolve the issue as I am still struggling to get the issue fixed - it‚Äôs been 3 weeks.Positives :1. The device is very light and easy to wear.2. The step tracking and heart rate is accurate3. Battery life comes close to 8-10 days with 24*7 heart rate and wrist sense on.4. The touch response and overall quality is good for the price."
Rakesh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worst app by Noise,"Watch is good but the app which it requires is one useless junk. It keeps resetting the data and the old data for that particular day is erased. There is no value less than 1 so giving 1 star.Watch has good features and functionality, we can get some approximate values about our BP, O2 level and different sports modes are available.Noise should definitely work in fixing the app as because of this app complete data is getting erased and you are forced to start from 0."
Srikanth,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not so worthy,Sleep tracking is not very accurate. Once I get up for 5 mins and sleep again.. it wouldn't track. The step counter is also completely wrong. Doesn't track the steps properly. The touch is good but overall not a worthy product
Omkar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good fitness smart watch but could be best,"Quiet good smart watch in this price range. Sleep tracking is quiet good, it's not 100% accurate but 95% accurate. It tracks only night sleep, It should track day sleep as well. Display, Touch, HR & Spo2 measurement is quiet good. One major missing thing is no of sports modes, 8 sports modes are very less. There should have been at least 15-20 sports modes in the pulse. Few major sports modes like gym, swimming are missing."
Rohan Bansal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Average product..,"Product looks and feel good on hand..Now coming to usage.. app is way to slow, data sync doesnt work at times.. it gets reset on its own, data gets erased...Faced multiple issues while using it...Watch restarts, when heartbeat iption is clecked.Watch faces are way too boring..While on selective faces. Watch goes blank.. need a restart to get back to menu.."
Avdhoot Bagwe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Over all watch is too good,Overall watch looks good.Almost all Features are good for real time tracking.I had done its water resistant test in pool amd it found absolutely good.Only one major disadvantage of this watch is its battery life is not enough (just 3 days support) hence i need to charge it many times.
Anup,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this at any Cost,Total money waste product.Don't take it if anyone gives it free.There is nothing saved in app if you unpaire everything will reset.After using for a month I can't get any call notifications.Aslo it is very irritating when you get continuous notification of call even if you answered it and more on after call end your watch will ring continuously for several times .I'm done with this watch . I'll never buy aur suggest anyone to use Noise products.It feels like I'm using 200 rupees watch buyed at road side.ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
DR.SHEEMA,3.0 out of 5 stars,No accurate step count,"I like the bult and look of noise colorfit pluse, perfect unisex watch.Worst part:1. Basic step counter itself is huge flop, it even runs while you are on bike or bus. Major draw back.2. Inaccurate calories counter and heart monitorThings that could have been better:1. It could have included few more sports modes.2. Options could have been made much simple"
Ashish,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bakwas, Don‚Äôt waste your money","This is bakwas product.Even default watchface been advertised is not available. Rest watch faces are aldo not good.Health quality apps (heart rate, spo2) shows some random reading which you cannot rely.In short I wasted money on buying this garbage"
Gagan Bedi ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product only accuracy issue.,Smart watch is good but little bit issue of accuracy of counting steps is there and heart rate also have some issue it's also not accurate.Else the product is good.
Jothsna,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good one with best customer care.,I got the product and after using it once it got switched off and I wasn‚Äôt able to turn it on inspite of multiple attempts. Luckily I registered the warranty of this watch before and I could contact the customer care. They were so helpful. They kept me updated with the product repair and shipping as well. Got the repaired product without any hassle.
Parvinder Singh Dalal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Product with no return policy,It is not at all touchscreen..we can't set the time....no option for returning back to the icons....we can't pick or dial any call using this....not at all worth...won't recommend anyone to purchase this useless watch...
Danish,2.0 out of 5 stars,Noise Fake Watch,"Not Good at all. This is Idiot watch. It is not Fake but It cannot measure my Heart Rate and Sleep Track at all. I slept for about 9 hours but it showed 4 1/2 Hours... Also when I was sitting And watching Twitch, I just did a test and tested my Heart Rate. For a minute it showed my 62 and then 136...Don‚Äôt buy this.. You may be thinking that this will be returned...NO..It doesn‚Äôt even Return..Do not buy"
Ritesh Pingle,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best smart watch but mobile app sucks.,"Pros:-best build quality.-removable starps.-tracking is perfect.-plenty of watchfaces.-touch screen is smooth.Cons:-small screen size.-app connectivity is sukcs. Go noise fit app sucks when it comes to UI and UX.-connectivity issues, sometimes connecting to Bluetooth is failed and it takes too much ti.e to connect with app."
Ashok,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wants to return and order someother good one.,"More than the product, the options in returning the watch or replacement request is too hoorible. Just a basic watch at the high cost. Even it is not worth to (2999/-) thats why i am telling.. waste of money. Please don't get cheated by buying it"
UR Gadgets ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Teenager's watch,Good for the price and amount of money you are spending. A teenager would love this watch.Look and feel of the watch is good.The display is small. It's almost 60 to 70 percent of the total watch face or dial.Call notification works well you can see the name on the display it gives you a option to reject the call if you want.Touch is not as sensitive and responsive as you use in the mobile or a tab.Music control is a good feature and works well.Other features works well like Steps. Heart beat. Sleep quality but is subject to calibration buts keeps a record of them in your noisefit app.
SATISH GIRI,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worse Product Total Loss of Money,Worse Product Even cannot be used for 2 Day software problem it was very embaarasing for me As I have gifted to my Senior Manager on His Birthday...Even I have applied for replacement but deu to medical emergency I asked the courier partner to Wait for someday but they refused my request and I lost my full Money Value buying this product....Not expected by Amazon

Vishnu p.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad experience Battery problem,The media could not be loaded. ¬†After 2 weeks it's completely shutdown. Battery problems facing right now. After charging battery drain very faster.Only 2 to 3 weeks I used suddenly it's happened. Here in Kerala there is no service center is showing. I don't know how many days and time will take this to find a solution. I need a replacement for this product.
SOUVIK DEB,4.0 out of 5 stars,Issue with App,The product is good. But the issue is with the app.It doesn't get connected easily and even though it connects the data does not get backed up.This has happened multiple times I lost my data. Still for this week my complete data is not backed up. The watch shows a different step count and the app shows another.
Yogesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Notification doesnt work in all andriod phone. Stop fake information,Notification doesnt work like whats app . Instagram . Email . I ordered watch i got it later it doesnt work in my phone vivo v5s . It work in real me phone i returned it again i order same item i check still it doesnt work i check with redmi phone it doesnt work . My phone is vivo v5s 4gb ram . 64gb storage. Bluetooth version 4 . So stop give fake information it work in all andriod phone.
Rawel Singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Money Wasted,"My only requirement was to keep track of distance I walk/run/cycle, but the readings this watch shows are inaccurate. Also it does not show the distance for cycling and will only tell you for how much time you did cycling. The mobile app does not get properly synced with the smartwatch, many of my activities do not get recorded in the app."
Srikant,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worst choice Noise Color Fit Pro2,"After 7 months I writting my review about the watch as below:-1. Display and style is very good, it really win my heart2. Step counting completely wrong. Waste of money. Don't buy3. Calories burn completely wrong. Waste of money. Don't buy.I have tried reset the settings in app in intial days just to reconfirm, I might have entered wrong input but after using it for 6 months now, I only use it as a basic watch in my hand."
cromwell.crusier,4.0 out of 5 stars,Go for it!!,"Well, I ordered this smart watch on 1st Jan 20 and within 2 days the order was delivered at my home.Item was well packed with invoice and sealed.Looks wise gonoise color fit pro 2 is outstanding and feels premium. The watch strap is also very durable and strong yet flexible.As for the performance.. this watch performs good although there is some variations in step counts and heart monitor but it's okay with this price.You have to install Noisefit sport app to sync your smart phone with watch.Although, I'm having this issue of watch and smart phone syncing. Every time when I disconnect the watch and try to connect it with my one plus phone it doesn't get connected to it automatically. For it I've to unbind and bind the watch again with my phone.Overall, this watch performs good at this price range. So go for it and don't forget to register it on gonoise website for warranty."
REJEESH,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cons rule!,"Lots of issues to be addressed.1. Disconnection often2. Call notification doesn't disappear even when we attend the call. Keeps on vibrating. Annoying.3. Only 5 watch faces and an option to take a pic and set as the watch face. No download option or app update to get more watch faces.4. Touch panel is not so responsive. Has to tap really hard to make it sense the input.5. Had tried to contact the manufacturer ro get the issued fixed multiple times but in vain.6. Noisefit app is also below par.***Pros:1. Battery back up.2. Light weight.3.LooksBut, all these doesn't matter if it's not doing what it is supposed to..!!!"

Sagheer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Inaccurate and tough to use,"Horrible product. The app sucks and step count is beyond inaccurate. It doesn't count steps when disconnected from the app which happens more frequently than you realize. Amazfit is easy to use, go for it. India should ban noise products. All reviews on this have been misleading."
Anurag Asthana,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as per expectation, it is for only counting steps and your heard beats no features.",Not very good experience with this even the back is not as per the what is mentioned on Amozon.in I F this will be the kind of services then it will be not good for the Service provider as may other big Indian companies are come into the play. It will have a good dent in the business of Amazon. Even you guys are ready to take it back.
Manju,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Waste of money, don't buy.","This is just a waste of money, the response is very slow, I wanted to return the product but there is no return option and the product is faulty.

RUPASHREE M S,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sports Mode activity selection becomes blank after pairing with iPhone XR,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Sports Mode activity selection becomes blank after pairing with iPhone XR. Before pairing I could click on sports mode icon and select run / walk/yoga etc. After pairing with iPhone I am able to select sports mode activity ONLY from the app. On the watch if I click on the sports mode icon the screen goes blank. So I am unable to select activity walk / yoga etc from the watch.
Rahul,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Advertisement is good, product not worth it","Pairing the device is a big challenge. Within three days i installed the app 10 times.Also the notifications are not happening all times.I was not happy, but Amazon is saying we can only exchange the product.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic,"Why you guys don't check the product functionality before dispatching it to the customer??

Would be grateful if you can refund the amount rather than replacing, we would choose from some other Company. Regards Col Goswamy"
Pomtoy Anurag ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Annoying.,"Problem with watch :1) Connectivity is worst. Even after pair, no notification, no synchronization, no alert or sms or alarm or phone call, I tured on all settings.2) Mobile application - worst.3) No easy way to take help from team.Good in watch.1) Tracking is Nice.2) Battery backup is nice.3) Touchscreen is also nice.4) Look is also premium.But over all it don't connect with smartphone.In starting it worked preet good but later it Became worst."
Sujan Choudhary,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall it's a good product.,It's a good product on this price.Mobile app is good but i gave 4 star because of some time it's disconnected with mobile app.And than you have to connect it again from starting.Baaki aap log isse le sakte hai acche hai or koi issue nhi aaya hai abhi tak.Battery life bhi gazab hai 7 days aram se chalti hai pata bhi nahi chalta hai ki charge bhi karna hi.Main toh bhul bhi jata hu charge karna.
Pawan Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,A really good purchase,"I really liked the product. It does everything it advertises. It can track sleep, track number of steps, track calories and basically everything a smartwatch is supposed to do. I would really recommend it to everyone trying to buy something similar."
raghu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Looks very style and class,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†Looks awesome, battery life very good, access soo easy, alerts and notification are too good,, using it from last 6 months,,, and only complaint i have is,, when it ask to update,, then i have to restart my mobile to recognise the device,,, rest all are superb,,, iam happy with the noise and Amazon..."

R. MANOJ ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth not connecting to my mobile,I purchased this product quickly delivered working no damage app to watch connected but Bluetooth not connecting to my mobile and music changing option not working I contacted to amazon team and I speak with them and I return this product
Karthik Sahasranaman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Above average product. Bit overpriced.,"@2999/- , could have added call accepting option as well. Nonetheless, good battery life. Got it on 3rd Sep, 30% battery still available even after regular use as on 15th Sep. Nice customisable screen. Pretty much accurate Heartbeat & SpO2 tracking. Good for active kids and certain section of grown ups."
Vandan Kumbhat,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bad at tracking pulse, overall experience is bad.","So I have used Honor Band 5 and Mi Band 3 and they are much better at being a fitness band as compared to this ( so called watch ). Doesn't track pulse properly at all, naps are not recorded. The app doesn't realise how to take smart average, if I am not wearing for 2 days of week it counts them in my avg sleep. Touch is bad too. Invest a bit more if you want a fitness watch or buy a band at this range."
Kanika,2.0 out of 5 stars,Useless item,"Firstly in among the 'many' sports modes it doesn't cover gym, aerobics, zumba etc the only thing it covers is yoga. Second n the biggest issue is that the watch keeps disconnecting from the app n u lose ur day's progress n the tech team at noise doesn't know what to do about it so yeah. Don't waste money on this"
Sach,1.0 out of 5 stars,Immature smart watch...Need to develop lot,"I bought it after looking at average ratings...however, lot of issue s with mobile apps... Not user friendly and many of the features not available. Synchronization is time consuming....Will not recommend to buy it..."
Sathish Kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth connectivity issues occur often in this watch,Watch was working fine for a week and Bluetooth doesnt connected and it disconnects automatically and pairing error occurs even though u try pairing with the QR code ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. This brand should consider fixing bugs in connection with app in smartphone
Richo Vargas,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad watch,"The quality is good but it has a big problem, it unpairs at least once a day. So if you trying to reach an specific goal of exercise daily or weekly you won't be able to do it, because when it disconnected you loose every data of the day.So it won't track your progress. So worthless because you buy a watch to storage the progress.They don't accept a refund, they will only give you another watch. Why would I like another useless watch?"
Swapneel S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not Purchased.,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†Discount device Everytime, Bluetooth not Searching Noise Color fit Pro Device,Call notifications and Vibration on Watch appear when you pick up the phone."
itsMk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best value for money smartwatch in the budget.,"Okay so the build is polycarbonate but it looks like metal , it's very handy and comfortable also looks stylish and yeah it has some bezels but doesn't look bad on wrist.The quality of material on this watch is good.All sensors like Blood Oxigen(SPO2), Heart Rate Monitor & Accelerometer are working fine, I've tested it's close to accurate.Raise to wake feature sometimes doesn't work at first.Overall it's a budget smartwatch and worth the price."
Ratnala Ashok Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super watch,"I got it for 2250rs, with is price range good watch. Looking nice on hand. Battery back up is ok. Accuracy of SpO2 is ok. Checked with oximeter. Shows 1-2% difference. Sports modes giving more , which r very good."
R.Rao,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your time and money! Not worth,"The watch and app are pathetic. When I bought the watch, all the fitness stats and notifications were working fine. After a couple of days, there was no sign of notifications. Even the readings were completely wrong.Heart rate monitor is so bad that, at the beginning of my workout it showed e.g 125 bpm and after 5 mins of cardio the readings on the watch dropped to 65 bpm!!!!Absolutely inconsistent and sheer waste of money. Highly disappointed!"
Sonam Malik,1.0 out of 5 stars,watch is not working properly,"i want a replacement of the watch , it is not working properly.tried many time to connect with your customer care but i did not get any response, After all possibilities I got this option only to write here. kindly look into this.i did not get charger also , i raised issue regarding this also but no response from your side.pathetic service.will not suggest to nyone for this product."
PhaniKrishna Ch,1.0 out of 5 stars,100% waste of money,"It is just a watch, other than that nothing is functional. Bluetooth always disconnects, no app notifications, automatically app changes to DND mode. App is dead slow, very poor performance. Highly dissapointed. Realme fitness band is 10 hundered times better that this in all ways."
Vaibhav Singh Thakur,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent services  and product!,"Excellent product and excellent customer services. My product got hanged some days back and after online registration of complain, my watch was picked by them and repaired it at their workshop in Delhi and delivered back at my place with a 15 days . Excellent services!"
Chetan Agarwal,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worthy,"Got this watch from Amazon.Since day 1 -Connectivity issues - watch gets disconnected anytime, and again you have to pair it.Notification issues - most of the times you don't get Notifications (even after updating the software and all)Built quality - in this price range its fine.I have registered the complaint to Noise, I am hoping they will replace the product.If they do so then 5 stars to their serviceIf they dont solve my problem then not even a single star to NOISE COMPANY itself."
TAPAS CHATTERJEE,1.0 out of 5 stars,Go for Noise Colorfit 3...,Its completely worthless..I already purchased Noise Cube..it was even better than this Pulse..No screen time adjusting..No attractive watch faces..at this cost..I prefer Noise colorfit 3 assist than t
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of hard earned money.,This product is firstly costing 3k with just pedometer with heart monitoring. Beside this its built & strip is of low standard. What we can get from other brand in 3000 is pedometer + heart rate + oxygen level monitoring + temp monitoring.Please invest your hard earned money with better product than this one.
Jigar soni,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad quality product with high range (don't do mistake to buy this product),This is a very bad quality product. Battery life is very redicules and very cheap range product performance. You have to charge this product twice in a 24hr. They claim for stand by 7-10 days. But this not a truth. The application of noise is taking too much battery of the mobile..Do not purchase this product. (BETTER TO CHOOSE ANY OTHER SMART WATCH FROM ALIEXPRESS.COM).
Prashant Joshi,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Product Certainly Noise...Go for It,I received itbon 10th Oct 2021 at ‚Çπ1700Packing & Delivery superb.Pros:1.Good Display2.Good Features in given price range.3.Elegant looks4.Battery (If you want to use as normal watch without connecting to App then Battery lasts till 15 days üëç)5.You can customise the display skin.Cons:1.Proximity sensor is not that quick2.App is laggy and major bugs.3.Less Skins avialable.so Good product in the price range...Go for It
Khusbu Agrawal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst smartwatch wrong tracking activity,It is not a smart watch. It tracks the activity wrong. I ran 5kms but noise recorded it as 7.8km apart from that it is annoying. Don't buy that otherwise I will be wasting your money. One more thing smartwatch can't be sold at such lower price I felt that. If it is not apple or samsung it is not smartwatchVery disappoint with the product
Anil Kaka,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of Time and Money,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†Noise Application is worst, due to which this smart watch is having poor value. Took 1+ hours to install noisefit app. And tracking is not to the mark. If your expectations are high, then don't go for this product as well as company. It's simply waste of time and money"
Pawan Kumar,3.0 out of 5 stars,A little disappointing,"I saw my cousin showing off his amazefit gtr on a wedding, I got jealous and ordered this, I didn't check much specifications, Just a few video ads and ordered it, Looking at those ads I was expecting it to be atleast half as good as my cousins watch, But when the watch came home, I honestly felt upset, The screen size, brightness, refresh rates are not even close to his watch. If u want a good smartwatch just spend more money.I know I was stupid to not watch the reviews and specifications, I will never do it again."
Archana M,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Harassment by Customer ""Support"" To provide feedback","The watch, when it finally connected to the finicky app, works well. I haven't used all the modes yet to give a true feedback but I'm being HARASSED nonstop by the Noise Customer Support team to provide feedback. So here it is."
Atharva,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad service of noise,"Very bad service of noise. I genuinely don't like the service because I have received a defective product my watch is getting restart atomatic i have to scan again and again I have contacted to Amazon customer care but my replacement date was gone so they told me to take to service centre, service centre told they can't service this watch because of some reason don't know why they told register and online complaint on noise website I have registered not a single reply has came from noise from 7-8 days .so now also my problem has not solved very service of noise"
Amit K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Premium features at amazing price,"Amazing watch with all the features I was looking for. I purchased it in 3499..accurate pedometer, heart beat and many more features. Watch gives decent battery backup and I charge it at every 5-6 days and I must tell u that I use it 24 hours a day.If noise improve their app then this watch is really unbeatable. Their app has following drawbacks as of now and that's why I gave them 4 star instead of 5 star:-There are no watch faces which shows battery statusActivity streak doesnot work for some reasons."
SHARANBASU DIGGI,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money.. beautiful design.,Smooth connection with 'mobile app'Touch screen is very sensitive and glides easily between the options.Sleep tracking haven't used much.. so can't comment.Overall a useful buy at the price.Different modes of motions like cycling etc needs little more precise accuracy.Rest all thumbs UP'
Vinodkumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,This smartwatch turns on automatically and goes away automatically.,The media could not be loaded. ¬†The new stories were great when I picked up the watch but it turns off automatically after I take it I do not understand why it is that problem or smart watch problem I do not know if there is any solution problem for this but I will give it to itRating 2 only ..Do you know if there is any solution for this or not? I do not understand how to do Ten Days I did not change how much I tried to change the email I saw another phone is also the same as my phone This phone will be the same as I understand what it isNo ..
Aashiq Saleem Malik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really awesome product,"Noise Gives you awesome features in all Watch,I'm happy with that product.Smart stylish and cool lookingFeatured-All messagesWhatsapp Gmail and many more notifications shown on watch it's totally awesome product"
Avinash Sharma,1.0 out of 5 stars,Noise do not have android app for this smartwatch.,Noise do not have android app for this smartwatch. Without app you can not scan and start it. Not getting an option for refund. Just replacement. Useless watch. They should clearly mention that there is no android app available for this device. Only iPhone users should buy it or buy a iPhone with the watch.Useless
LT,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fail in basic features.,"Although a good watch, but push notifications aren't coming spontaneously. Everytime I hv to switch them on from my app. Again i find that it's off. Despite switching on, notification doesn't appear. Initially for 1-2 days, it came, but not now. Idle alert activity alarmer is also not correct., As despite being active, it shows, that Pl take activity.Also, if Timer or Stopwatch is on, then u can't use the watch for viewing time, which is ridiculous.So kindly correct these basic features."
selva gnanakrishnan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money,"Beast for this price range, I received this product at 6th Oct, I charged on 6th, now it's 17th Oct with 40% charge remaining, sleep tracking is not you shld expect from this watch my only issue is touch to wak would be a best, raise to wake not perfectly works all the time, overall value for money, you can't expect everything in this price range right, so for this price range it is the beast, I bought at 1,700. Don't spend more than this, wait for the offer then buy"
Amar,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Watch is OK, but the app is Worst","Watch is just OK, but the user interface and the app is very worst. Many simple actions missing or does not work well. Watch faces are only few and not really customizable. Tracking is good, but not able to analyze well with app."
Rajendra,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad product,"This is just a digital watch not more than, wrong heart rate it showing my heart rate 110 in normal conditions,It continue disconnected with phone,No alarm it's only vibrated,No proper notification come of my phone,You can not control volumes of music,It's price not more than 1000/-"
SUDHAN,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste,Money waste two apps are given to control watch both are not perfect waste of money instead by one plus band
Bhushan,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's good but can't expect much from it!,Screen felt old for a guy who has used all kinds of smartphones with their progressive features.Water resistance should be matched with that of Boat.Mobile app doesn't record activity sessions from the watch.Sleep tracker shows data even for the day when it was switched off.Can't be used for wearable app development.Build quality is good.Screen brightness could be better.Battery backup is good.Best for gifting it to a college student.
Kikomeko Tonny Galabuzi,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very poor. Waste of Money . Don't buy,"It's a completely different watch.When u connect, t shows T55 instead of the noise Colorfit pro 2.It's button is at the the top. .what I ordered the button is in the middle. Very poor quality . I'm returning it."
Amazon user,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only Indian product in the flood of Chinese product with great performance and decent price,"Guys, recently purchased this watch and pretty satisfied with its performance. The watch comes with 5 watch faces and on full charge the battery lasts for 7-8 days which pretty good. The step tracking may not be totally accurate but its not the show stopper. You can also check notifications from Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook or SMS's. It also provides Idle alert, sleep tracking, Music control, Phone finder, Auto heart rate monitor.Touch screen is also very responsive.If you are looking for smartwatch go for it guys, Noise is the only Indian company which provides one of the best smart watches at these prices. Don't go for chinese companies like Mi, RealMe or Honor, go India.This is the time to support Indian companies."
Ayesha,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worst,Very disappointed with the product1. Watch Face- it takes 2 min time to change the watch face from the app (very slow)2. No continues hear rate monitoring - every time we need to go to the menu then check3.SPO2- it takes 3 min for result some time shows wear watch tightly and try again like this4 Notifications - after picking call continuously vibration üì≥5 Notifications - if we get any other language WhatsApp messages it shows ¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø Like this6. Menu - Like Nokia 1600One of the worst product from Noise
MJ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Inaccuruate,"I have monitored this watch for >24hrs, data was inaccurate, while sleeping it shows I took 840 steps. While operating Laptop for 1&1/2 hours it shows I took 81 steps. Sleep time was accurate."
Bindya,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed completely,This thing stopped working within 1 month. I've already sent an email to Noise team for it. Waiting for them to either call back or respond to the mail. Kept for charging still it's not working. It was just lying down on the table. N suddenly heated up and stopped working. I've wasted my money.. NOT WORTH!!!
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovin' it,I am a 12 years old guy. This watch is next level. I got this as my diwali gift and I would say that this is the best diwali gift I have ever received.Pros- Touch screen is super smooth. Looks premium. Watch faces are awesome. Gives accurate measurements.Cons- Didn't find any.Conclusion- Highly recommended.
Lohith,1.0 out of 5 stars,Services not good for the product 30 days this kind of its only four to five days for returning,Worst customer service and customer care does not contact by calls we should type of all the details in that from what does not take the complete itself fastest service ever seen before going see the product it has been manufactured in China and tell that it's made in India manufacturer in India
Seshabhushan ,1.0 out of 5 stars,WASTE OF MONEY ..POOR QUALITY.. SYNC ISSUE..,Waste of Money and time.I have purchased Noise colorfit pro 2 with lot of expectation but from day 1 was facing issue.

Ankit,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good in the price range,"I was so hyped by the overview, it's a nice smartwatch. Works extremely well.The band color is such a dissatisfaction. I bought grey, and just in 1 day it looks so dull and I am sure it will turn yellow in no time. That's why I want to exchange it with another color or return this item but Noise is not providing the best regards."
Pips,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic Battery. Do NOT buy please,Battery Lasted for 1 month after purchase. Dont know how to get it replaced since it is supposedly under warranty.
Bharath S,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Product design ,value for money with good battery backup","I have been using this product for about 6 months, so far so good. noiseapp could have been developed better and mainly on Iphone it has synch issues,You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone battery backup is good. there are good and bad about this product here is the list.Good- Price, Looks, touch screen, battery backupBad-Step calculation and Heart rate reading is not accurate, mainly the Noise app on iphone is not good."
Harsh Vardhan Rathore,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth what I paid for,first of all the reason to buy is that this comes with brand which will give you assurance of it's image and reputation and due to that they will take care of customers...Nice finishing and good packaging ...working fine so far it's been a month now using this and I like it .... though few more features has to be there but I. know that comes with the price too ...overall good product in this price range...
Sunny Vaghadia,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing performance,"Very comfortable to wear it. Looks like an apple watch. But, the sleep meter is not working. The touch is very poor. The awake reaction is very very poor. (Approx 2 seconds). The new app is really making key features like the selection of default media players, Very limited watch faces, Poor notifications."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great battery life up to 10 days with heavy use,Believe me I used this watch over 2 months now I'm writing this review .Let me go with pros1 Great battery life than any smart watch2 eye catchy look3 easy to connect (Bluetooth)4 9 sports modeCons1 Tracking sports is not that accurate2 Little slow with wrist motion3 Display light not great Any way it's good but some issue's with tracking how these should be rectified in next update
Mausumi Khanrah,4.0 out of 5 stars,An Awesome buy!!!,"NOISE COLORFIT PRO 2AFTER USING THE WATCH FOR A WEEKThis is a very good product. It has various features . The watch can go for 7 days without charging. The look of this watch is very stylish . I can wear it as a sporty yet glamorous look .For people with thin wrists , it will fit just right . I , myself have a thin wrists and it fits me perfectly. The watch is very compatible with today's world.THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS WATCH BETTER I do see the hours of sleep in my app but it would have been better if it was visible on the watch. It has minor glitching when you are shifting the screens . Other wise the touch screen is pretty good.SUGGESTION I would totally suggest to buy this watch. It is a great buy."
Sahil Ukande,5.0 out of 5 stars,Watch is Not in a Box,The watch was missing only charger was there.I got it today and i order it for my friend as a birthday gift but damn when he open there was nothing.I file a report and they said wait for 2 to 3 days to complete the investigation. Lets see what happens.I trust amazon but it happens with me for the first time ever.Fingercrossed hope for the best.Edited: I got my money back thank you amazon.
Rohit Kumar Singhal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product and customer service,I definitely regret ordering this product. It is of no good and the customer service is of no help whatsoever. Kindly look for return and exchange policies on other products before making a purchase and do not buy this one in my opinion.
dheeraj,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt buy at all,This is a very bad product. Battery drops very very fast. Tried to return or replace but they are not doing. Plz don‚Äôt waste your money on such cheap product. This is the worst experience I ever had on Amazon.

Mahesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unhappy with the product,"Old product now, over a year old. Thick bezels, watch faces not good, font not good, the mobile app response is really slow. Not fun to use at all. Also overall the various trackers aren't v accurate. Going to be buying the amazfit gts 2 mini. Wish I'd waited a couple of days to order it."
Amit Maurya,3.0 out of 5 stars,Service center not available.,"Stopped working after 10 month of usage. Censer light of watch is always on and it switch aff after 1 hour of charging.No service center are available in nearby areas only 4 service center are available in U.P., online process is very pathetic.It was my first and now last product of noise."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Can be tried once,"Sleep tracking is a nice feature, but it is not accurate.Touch screen has a lagHeart rate shows 57, which is not correct. When we rest that time it shows 110 and above.Screen is good, looks good, we can configure screen background, would be better if we could also configure clock when we use our screen background"
Lakhan Bhujbal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wrist product ever,"Highly disappointed with this product, the sensons are very not responsive, only thing come with this is the large display size and battery life, the rest remaining thing like function, watch faces, modes are disappointing.The strap material of poor quality turns black within a few days, the dial material looking great but the durability is very less within a week or two you will find the signs of paint removal.Don't buy this product. Even there's is no return policy."

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product,"I really like this product, and awesome to wear, I suggest to buy this. Only deal is the App. Not working good. Noise must focus on the app, taking long time for syncing. Otherwise watch is too stylish and good product"
Rahul Martin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Dont buy, better options available","very limited watchface options, low response time on screen. but okay for the price range. this the first time i ordered something which is amazon basic suggestion and got turned down. much better options available at same range"
Ashwin Rao,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sturdy and durable smart watch!,I have been using this from last 3 months. Watch face is durable and resistant to small scratches. Well built and serves the purpose. Liked about battery which is long lasting and apperence. Only suggestion is to increase the number of watch faces.
Vijay,3.0 out of 5 stars,Can improve.,The app misbehaves often and step count suddenly reverts to an earlier status. Sleep is not accurately counted unless it is deep sleep. Bluetooth connection is often problematic. Additional features like blood pressure monitoring will be useful.
Khushbir singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,The watch has stopped responding to touch just 5 days after operating it,It was gift to my relative... Just 5 days later I come to know that the touch isn't working of the watch. I have contacted their service centre and no one came no resolve were done and I get a message saying the issue was resolved... The watch still isn't responding... Please help if possible.
P S Jacob,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product without band is waste of purchase,"Good choice to own but it‚Äôs straps are not to expectations, forced to replace in six months to nine months, and not available in Amazon.When tried to buy band of any color in Gonoice stores site, always it‚Äôs not available or sold out.

Ruchi Gupta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,"Its been 2 months I am using the noise colorfit pro 2 smartwatch. It is a very good to buy smartwatch in the price range. I will definately suggest this watch to buy. Best buy in the range.I liked:* It looks really good on hand and the belt material is very nice.* It has all the features required like steps count, Calories burnt, Distance travelled, various sports mode, alarm, music control, heart rate, stopwatch, and few more.* Water resistance and battery backup is really nice.* Customisable watch face is a really nice feature.* You can change screen brightness too, which helps set indoor/outdoor brightness.* Another good thing is it is very easy to update the firmware of watch.I have observed below issues:* It shows wrong sleeping hrs. It adds the hrs in my sleep even after I am awake or before I go to bed.* Warranty registration process is very bad. No confirmation mail or sms of registeration.* Menstruation tracking is a bit hard to understand on watch face."
Kajal bhalla,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not upto Expectations .,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†Respected sir , I recently received my ordered product Noise colourfit pro 2 . However Look is Fabulous from distant but product didn't meet my quality as i expected and most disappointing thing is It get disconnected automatically,furthermore sometimes doesn't show notification. Secondly dishearten action was that i could not able to access my wallpaper on watch and have very limited watch faces. Built Quality is not soo good, It looks like cheap product. I advise you to please utilize the screen size."
Patan Mahammed,4.0 out of 5 stars,All is well,"It's been 2 weeks since I got this watch and this is my reviewPros**1. watch looks are great2. Activity tracking is great3. Battery life upto 7 day, if 24/7 heart rate is on4. Smooth interface5. Great watch facesCons1. Pedometer is not that accurate2. Missing camera shutter and Breathe app for meditation3. Missing some key features like it has music control but name of songs and sound control is not availableOverall its a best watch under this budget"
Avik Banerjee,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great product in a low price,I am using this product for 1 week now. Here is my review:1. Great battery backup. I had to charge once in this whole week.2. Mobile app is intuitive and connects easily.3. Tracking features work great.Only thing is SpO2 is not consistent in results. You have to tighten the watch on your wrist properly to get proper counting.
Ishu Gupta,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not up to the mark,"The watch does not connect or notify whatsapp messages qnd calls also GPS required to be turned on when using noise app. Overall, it just qualifies the designation of a plastic toy to check steps. Mi band is a better cheaper choice."
Avinash,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worthless product i have ever purchased,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†Worthless product i have ever purchased, i ordered it on 6 sep and from day 1 the battery backup is only 2 days, i thought this might be because of my curiosity of touching watch again and again but on 23rd sep the battery goes dead. For reference please see the attached video."
rahul kalra,1.0 out of 5 stars,Receievd a non working watch which even after full battery is not just switching on.,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†The watch does not just switch on. It's a headache when these things happen on Amazon. Also when we had asked for replacement, there was only one option of return and refund. As if the company knows that they have less no of functional watches and they have oversold on Amazon."
Abhijith Suresh,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Happy Customer !,"I purchased the product Noise Smart watch from Amazon. Iam truly delighted to say that the product is top notch and flexible and made out to be an unavoidable favourite to my wardrobe.The accuracy is just WOW, the displayed distance and calories burned are the exact. The price was affordable considering the features.Coming down to delivery, the super fast delivery from amazon team deserves a kudos.Coming down to cons, I should say that the watch faces are limited and no extra presets are available for this product. For sleep accuracy its not that accurate. Iam well aware that i purchased this product 8 months ago and surely Noise has made many improvements in this time period. So No issues !And for the customer representative lady who was friendly but professional was top of her field with good communication skills. Give her a raise !All around a happy customerThank you"

pranati,1.0 out of 5 stars,Watch stopped working in 10 days,"Watch stopped working in 10 days. Created support ticket on colorfit support website, but it will take 15 days for them to respond. Very poor after sales service. Please stay away from this brand."
FAREEZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The device's battery got affected within a month. No sleep tracking. Now, it's not working.",The sleep tracking doesn't work. The battery got affected & it stops working. No Spo2 level shown. Although the sports mode worked perfectly. The biggest drawback is it's the battery. Disappointed. Lost money.
RAGINI,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purposeful watch,I used this watch for 3 months now and I found no issues with that.It has all the basic features which anyone want for day to day purpose.You can buy without second thought. Noise has a good after sales services as well.
Ishaan Kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not at all what you think it is.,Don't be fooled by the number of reviews or the rating. The app for this watch dosent load watch faces no matter how much you debug. The watch only has options to disconnect the call. Complete waste of money. You can't even return this to Amazon. You can only replace. My advice: Go for Boat smartwatch or MI smartwatch. But never this!!-completely frustrated customer
ND,3.0 out of 5 stars,Looks good but not as useful as I thought,It's been a month or so. The product looks good but not as useful as I assumed it would be. One has to remember to switch on the modes everytime like walking/running etc so it doesn't automatically track. Also the heart rate isn't very accurate. Overall the design is quite nice and works very basic. Don't seem to get call notifications for some reason.The product developers can definitely work on the shortcomings so it's a seamless experience.
Faraz Khan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Feels like cheated,"Worst smart watch by Appario retail and Amazon, Heart rate is never accurate, device restart issue, app connectivity issue, once the device is restarted it is very tiring to connect with the android mobile applicant provided by noise and the most important part is the brand ambassador of this product is Rohit Sharma and he is ruining his image by promoting such cheap quality Chinese product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. GO FOR SOME OTHER OPTIONS."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Average,Accuracy is a concern. Running for 5kms shows less in Noisefit compared to other device. Footsteps accuracy not good. Sleep data not good.Not Satisfied. Resmi n Mi are much better devices.Prefer FitBit n apple products.
Aatika,3.0 out of 5 stars,Improvement Required,"Mobile app could‚Äôve been better with more customisation features. Like switch off option, pairing/unpairing option. The UI/UX of the app is quite basic and old school. Sync option should be available on home/first page of the app from UX perspective. Wrist sense doesn't work smoothly in watch."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worthless product.,I had bought a Noise colourfit pro 2 smart watch from @amazonIN on 27Dec20. Its not connecting and after replacement also im facing the same issue .Worst product ever. Already waisted my Rs200 for the screenguard protection. It really sucks how bad the quality is.Need refund of 200.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,üòç Perfect ü§©,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†It‚Äôs the best smart watch I have ever seen. Before this one, I had the MI smart band 4. And this watch is much better than MI smart band 4. It‚Äôs touchscreen doesn‚Äôt lag and whenever somebody sees this watch the first time, they have only one Question. ‚Äú Applewatch, right!‚Äù I love this product üíó"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy it!! Waste of money!,Worst quality. Not worth it 2900/- just wasted my money over this. Return policy is also not available. Very disappointed with this. Watch strap quality is very cheap. The touch doesn't work properly. I have really expected so much. This was a gift for someone and I can't be gifting something cheap.
Vijay- HE CRM,4.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfactory product.,"Satisfactory product, but dissatisfied in notification while incoming calls getting full ringing vibration comparing realme band vibrate for three times oly and in boat watch, vibration can be modified via app on same price segment. Watch face are good and touch sensor is better. Display size is good."
chirag patni,1.0 out of 5 stars,Watch stopped working just after a month and a day.,"In starting i believed that its a nice product in pocket friendly price, but very soon i start regretting my decision as it doesn't support any third party strap bands. And walla after a month and a day it stopped working. And when i tried to charge the watch to attempt a reboot or something else, it just start vibrating continuously during charge and on screen i saw nothing, SERIOUSLY. Is there anychance for any kind of exchange at this point."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"According to the cost of the product, you cant expect more than that.","This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with bluetooth. You need to download noisefit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SMS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner).Heart rate monitor is closely correct. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Real count of a cumulative of 3 steps. Alarm works well. Truly water proof."
BHAVESH RATHOD,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worthless... !!,Totally wastage.. As i bought it month ago.. Connectivity is poor... Touch is not that accurate... Less feature's... Most weired thing as it gets disconnected suddenly as the app (noise sports) shows uh connected... No calls could bd shown properly... Wastage of money recommend not to buy...!!
Bhoomi Sharma,3.0 out of 5 stars,The app for this watch is worst and their costumer service too.üò†,Watch is all okay.. No issues till now.. but the app for this watch which is Noisefit app is just worst.. it was good only for 2-3 days then it started creating problem.. my watch record my every activity but it didn't showed up in the app so many times. I do workout daily in 4 sessions so i want proper record and sometimes it doesn't show 2 or 3 sessions and some i lost the whole day activity.. i complained about that to the app costumer service on whatsapp. So they came up with a temporary solution that is uninstall the app and reinstall. And when i did so in the middle of the day i lost all the data.. from app and watch too..
jaspreet singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Be carefull noise pro 2,I have been using this product for last 20 dasy Worst softwear noisefit. This softwear doesnot run in mobile background. You wont received any msg and call alert. You will have to go back and click agin on that noise fit app then youbwill receive alert for some time again the it will stop again. Over all noise pro 2 not comapatible with there softwear. I have done big mistake to buy this product. Be carefull.
Ashu Verma,1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete waste of Money.,"3rd class product. Have wasted my money. Damn slow performance. The app is pathetically slow, working like was developed in the stone age. You may get better products by adding a couple of another hundred Rupees. Don't waste your money. No Return. Bound to Stay with it.Amazon support is fantastically pathetic as well."
jacksonjegatheesan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good battery Life,The best thing about the product is battery lifestep tracking is good (not the best)things you don't get is a perfect activity trackertotal calories burnt for a 2.45 km running and 2.45 km walking was the same that itcalculates calories burnet in case of distance and time taken instead of personalized way
Mahesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"False Promises, No call/sms alerts, NO RETURN POLICY( just replace ), Not worth price.. Money wasted","1. Alarm function doesn't operate.2. Music doesn't function even after connecting with smartphone.3. Call /sms notifications are not available as shown in advertisement. There is NO RETURN POLICY, simply you can replace it with another piece of this fitness tracker. So, even after experiencing these shortcomings, customer service told that it can be replaced, cannot be returned. Wasted the money. So, think 10 times before ordering it."
Sidhartha Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing watch...,look of this watch is very good and very lightweight to use.battery backup is amazing and it run for almost 15 days after fully charge.need to provide update for noisefit app so that new watch faces can be downloaded and we can experience some more features.The only cons is: after few time of usage when you receive or cut call then it take some time to response from mobile device. apart from this overall experience is good and using it from almost last 1 month.
Kiran,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Watch !,"Nice watch to buy , not just because it looks like Apple watch but it has many things that makes it buy , It has a large variety of sports modes - Run , Walk , Workout , Yoga , Spinning , Bike , Hike and much more , sleep tracking is also 90% accurate , app is also nicd one . But there are not much of watch faces , it has 12 - 15 but it needs more . Very much satisfied with other things"
Ansh pandey,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dont buy this watch,This product is good for use but the after buying with 5 months i faced problem with the charging port and went to noise for a replace as was under replacement term but the workshop people clamied that it is company policy that they dont give new peice they give the peice which is repaired and product is of another customer
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth buying,"Initially, there was issue with logging into app. After several months of usage, the battery capacity has reduced drastically so much so that stand-by mode would last only for 24 to 36 hours which was previously about a month.Quite unhappy with the product."
Chira,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dated design,I bought it because of the number of positive reviews and because it was a trusted product. Looks just as good as the pictures.However the LCD screen is hard to get used to after phone display. Consider going for newer watches with Alexa
Ankita Bansal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied but noise app is not supporting properly with my phone.,"The noise app gets hang in my mobile while no other.I received order on 6 oct and on 7 oct evening i complain for an exchange as it as small scratch but now at mid night, cancel that exchange and put it on refund bcz that noise app is not supporting my mobile. App gets repeatedly disabled with device. Also not able to track sleep data. Used it pne whole day to check if it works but it gets disconnected i don't why. May b there's a issue with my phone. Touch is good and water resistant is perfect."
hardik patel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall good in terms of built quality and look but below average in performance.,"Value for Money - in terms of- Built Quality- Overall Look and design- Battery Backup (more than 10 days)But one problem which is irritating me is a connectivity issue with a mobile application.Need to reconnect twice in a day and sometimes not get a proper alert of notification, but I think it is a software issue which can be updated in a future update."
Steve David,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent work at this price!,"At just 2k you get so much sports modes, sleep tracking which is pretty accurate, heart beat monitor also works accurately! But only thing which was missing was spo2 accuracy but still it's acceptable for a smartband at same price of a normal spo2 monitors coming in market! At the end of the day good deal! But it doesn't means every deal with amazon would gonna be a good one! There could be some bad ones too!"
D. ANIL KUMAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,"Noise colorfit pulse watch is a vary beautiful watch and this watch specification features is a not bad , there are like sleep monitoring and HR & sp-o2.But watch faces available in 50+ watch faces I am disappointed but no problem customising watch face available know üòÅ.So finally this watch is vary nice & comfortable......üòçüòçüòä"
Akriti Gupta,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst Display Quality, Watch hangs and now i can't even return",Worst product please don't buy.Go for amazefit or honor watch.Even mi band is better than this.I am regretting buying this product.8-10 watch face and all are worst.This watch has hanging problem.Display quality is very bad.Please don't buy.. never ever.
Samiran Thakuria,2.0 out of 5 stars,Raise to wake scam.,So the watch seems fine at first but as you use it for some time you start to notice the problemes.1. The raise to wake is hit or miss.. It's misses 70-90% of the time is the watch screen was off for some time.2. The build quality is good but it looks incredibly cheap. The black one kinda looks like a toy.3. The phone app is also very slow and sometimes is doesn't even open. And the watchface take very long to apply.Not recommended.. Go for dizo watch 2.
Devansh Jain,1.0 out of 5 stars,It is not a smart watch and there are many issues too.,"Though the product is being marketed as smartwatch, you will find many smartbands having more features than this.You hardy get aware of the notification and you cannot read more than 2 lines of a message or open a message. It Lags, it restarts automatically, some features works sometime and sometime they don't.That 1 star is only for the design."
Akshat,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst product, stay away","This is simply a cheap Chinese product, stay away from his, this is just a piece of crap and Amazon will not refund for this crap. Half of the features are highly misleading..."
Sharath Nambiyar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Budgetary Smart Watch,"Decent build qualityAffordable priceBetter functionalityBelow average screen qualityAccesibilty/ Icons not that goodConnectivity issues (not that frequent, but its there )If you are looking for a smart watch to track the walking/running activity, Time and to get call/ message alerts you can definitely go for it ."

Satish R,3.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money But poor Build Quality,If you are looking for decent smart match with a affordable cost you can go for it. But overall build quality of the product is pretty bad. Especially plastic outer rim where in the straps connects is very flimsy. Looks like it will break in normal wear and tear. Also app interface for the android can be improved looks very basic .
Dr Manjunath G,1.0 out of 5 stars,Average,It's a v average watch. I loved my previous watch amazfit with amoled screen but that cost me twice as much. But even for this price this watch is avg for me
Rk,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's good.,-Battery backup is excellent.-Watch faces are not impressive.-There is no call received option. As there call end option available.- if you used it as normal watch then battery backup are 10-12 days.-allover it's good.

Sushant Duggal,3.0 out of 5 stars,"now its cheap but not the best,","Was expecting more from colorfit pro, its cheap on its price, but so are the features, also many glitches and some priority app functions which cant be edited . so overall i would say for the new ones reading my comment, dont buy this and wait for the better version."

Alston Alvares,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing Sleep Tracking, Amazing Heart Rate Monitor, Amazing Build Quality all at a budget!","I liked the fact that even under and budget you can track daily steps, distance, calories burnt, heart rate and sports mode. The sleep tracking work like a charm. The sportmode might not be accurate every time and sometimes shows weird data but works smoothly. The touch is good even if it's wet but the swipe animation is bad and laggy. It makes the touch response feel slow. Build wise it's pretty tough. But you have to expect scratches on the display if you use it roughly. On a full charge it does last around a week as said. Overall it's has to be the winner in this price range. But do expect less features."
chaitanya,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't go by old reviews, update is very good","Review after 10 days usageSeemed waste of money at first but got an update in noise pro app and it just worked fine .1)Good connectivity, though notification are little late ( 1 second roughly)2)heart rate is good almost accurate, checked in parallel with medical device3) battery backup is great almost just as they say 10 days battery Cons1) no spo22) though display is good but notifications and call alert seems not a eye catcher Overall don't go by the old reviews just buy the product I bought it for2499"
Sandy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks classy, decent features at great price","Using it for 2 days now, yet to see the battery life. So far, pretty accurate. Looks stylish.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review,"Very worst product, after two weeks touch screen stop working, I had raised complaints they collected the watch af that no update.

Damaayanti K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY GOOD,"It's a really good smart watch. It has all the necessary options to check number of steps, calories burnt etc. However, what I liked best is an inbuilt period tracker for women. Extremely helpful. Would suggest you buy this."
Isaac Madhavan,2.0 out of 5 stars,A massive disappointment,"Amazon's delivery was excellent, as usual.The Noise Colorfit Pro 2 is a massive disappointment. The heart rate monitor is quite erratic; I've worn the watch tight and loose but can't figure out how to get it to work consistently. And, the sleep tracking is essentially non-existent.With the above two functions being so bad, I just can't trust any other information it supposedly gives."
Monojit Karmakar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worthless smart watch,I have purchased noisefit smart watch on 14th august 2021 and within just one month the watch got blanked automatically without any reason. The watch neither fell down nor thrashed anywhere but it is not working any more. And most horrible part is service center is not co operating with me to repair the watch despite of it is in warranty period. Totally disappointed.
Mehul kapadia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noise Pro - 2 Smart watch,Excellent Packaging Before time delivery many video shows it lacks a lot but if you update the firmware version it does not lack at all .. the best part is you can change the wallpaper of dial as well from official Noise app. The only major clawback is if you twist you hand to see the notification or timings it takes 3 seconds to react . No compromise on design and looks worth to buy very light in weigh just 35gms .. different color straps available in market.I best experience is IPV68 Water proof technology I worn and went on Bike Ride once I received it today and it was superb experience in total 5 star for water proof as even water on dial screen it reacted quickly while on low light or high lights .
Poojitha Reddy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too worst.. Waste of money,"Too worst.. This is not like original noise smart watch,low quality product. Iam not going to suggest any one to buy this product in sale because the boxing is also different, straps also looking very cheap. Unsatisfied with this product. I tried to replace it with different but it's not allowing to us, they will just replace the same product in same colour not even the different colour. Waste of money"

Good in this range...I got this at 2000 worth it..but it is so difficult to connect first time...sometimes it just disconnected and stop notifying...

Pranava,3.0 out of 5 stars,Lifetime of only 10days. Don't buy - Edited as received a replacement watch,Bought this watch on 27th July prime day sale and it stopped working within 10 days. Watch is dead. 2500/- for 10 days lifetime is ridiculous. Useless product. Don't waste your money.-Update on 25/08Noise support has picked the watch and delivered a replacement one couple of days ago. New watch is going good so far. I really had no hopes on the support but it turned out to be a surprise to have a replacement delivered!

Rishi,4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is good but not value for money,Over all the product is good but not value for money. If we compared with BoAt Smart (Rs. 2000) watch the features are more than noise smart watch. Also we can use itin the swimming pool and we can measure our blood pressure as well. But in noise those features are not there and price as also too high.
Amit Mishra,4.0 out of 5 stars,Noise Watch #aaslireview #unpaidreview,"Have been user if Noise product for long, this watch lived up to it. Firstly thanks to Amazon for on time delivery.Watch looks primium, build quality is good, display can be better (should expect an upgrade on next model), battery is good and lives up to the committee timelines. Navigation on watch us easy and quite user friendly.I was impressed by the app designed to sync this watch. It was easy, quick and very subtle.Recommend for daily use.Noise should consider making products in India and continue offering such good product at competitive prices."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad product,"From day 1 of purchase it's having connectivity issue, bluetooth getting disconnected and watch gets restarts 2-3 times in a day,no proper customer support also,I had taken during discount day,it's a defective product,which is sold during the disc8days of Amazon."
Vinay sukhija,4.0 out of 5 stars,Go for it!,"Really efficient watch for its price point. The sleep tracking is working extremely well and you can also set reminders to drink water or to take a walk after being idle for a certain amount of time. The app interface could be better but I'm certain they are working on it. The raise to wake feature does not work all the time but I don't expect it to work all the time for this price. Also, the support team was super helpful and answered all my queries!"
JijiVS,4.0 out of 5 stars,A great fitness watch for the price,The watch is pretty elegant and there are plenty of watchfaces to choose from. The lack of custom watchfaces is undesirable. The display is slightly sluggish which is expected from the comparitively low price.
Daison,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall fairly good for the price tag,"It's a good watch to track steps and sleep patterns, heart rates, connect with phone to receive notification of calls.. but the battery life is not so great.. For this price range the battery life should be able to last for longer time. But it lasts for max 2 days or so, which in opinion needs improvement.. overall enjoying the fitness tracking experience of the watch."
mutteringsofmemyself,5.0 out of 5 stars,Road to fitness,It‚Äôs been a month almost since I picked the Colorfit Pulse. I am really happy with the product and it‚Äôs performance.It‚Äôs daily tracking is helping me push myself to meet my fitness goals and most convenient feature is the long battery life. I don‚Äôt have to worry about constant charging and am truly able to be on the go with my pulse watch!
Abhishek Kumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product.,Good product. Battery life is good. around 8 to 10 days battery life in normal use. I'm observed the alert are not giving as programmed. Screen/display is not protected with skreathgard or etc. but overall good. 4 star are deserved.
Afzal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not very accurate product. Didn‚Äôt find it usefull,Heart rate monitoring is not working correct. I Didn‚Äôt wear the watch & still it has recorded some readings. during my intense workouts it shows 70bpm.Step count is not accurate. Shows more readings when compared to my iphone.Watch face collections are less as compared to other brands.
Arun Prakash Peechanari,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sync issues with Mobile App,"Having sync issues with Mobile app. After outdoor running in Sports mode, it got updated in Mobile app recent activities section(So not any connectivity issue) but was not getting updated in steps, calories or distance. If that is not getting recorded then what's the point of having this watch. Pathetic watch, I don't recommend buying.Also it was showing few steps and distance while I was sleeping üòÇ"
Shubhankar Thakur,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth buying,The sensitivity of the watch is very annoying whenever you want to see time lights of LED is not able to sense. I would like to suggest noise to build a responsive firmware in next update.Battery isgood enough but sleep tracking also not working properly.
Ashok,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Avrage quality, worst experience with the app","Peoples looking for low price smart watch can buy. Watch straps are tooo thin. Dosent worth the money. This watch and noice app do not synchronise properly, you will keep on finding surprising issues"
vishwas ural,2.0 out of 5 stars,Okish product for this price,"First time i started the watch, i was in shock because of display. My older fitbit had a better ppi than this watch. The touch screen reminds me of first generation of android mobile with resistive touch screen, you need to tap hard for it to work. The app just disconnects from the watch and you have to restart the app to sync and have music control back"
Vineeth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for money and starting point for a fitness influence gadget.,"The product is true value for money, works well with my samsung galaxy S7edge. Had a good influence of my life style. The battery life is awesome 8 to 10 days. The black one is good looking. Good starting point for a fitness influence gadget."
parveen kumar ahuja,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not pairable with IPhone XR,"One watch is working & paired well with android mobile & another is not computable with IPhone XR Hence wanted to return one of them, please advise how to return it"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst,Sleep monitoring is not working and the steps are not accurate.It is not capturing the data accurately.Value of money is too high for this product.I have replaced the dial still same problem continues and for replacing they are charging some amount and there are very rare service centers.
Abdullah,3.0 out of 5 stars,Provide Tempered Glass And we need full screen display,Recently purchased this item.... honestly According To Price Watch is not Up to mark... Under 2k would be justifiable price... One thing That I like About This Watch Is battery Backup amazing 5/5 One week easily.... I‚Äôm requesting to @noiseindia please provide at least one Tempered glass for protection... because within a week My Watch Broke from the edgePrice is ok But most Features are Missing like can't call or or pick And the most Disappointment thing (half screen) & according to the price please provide a Tampere Glass at least for more durability
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unable to pair to iPhone 12,It‚Äôs total waste for me. I am unable to pair the watch. Due to lock down I got this watch now only. When I try to pair it. I did not see the noise fit 2 in the watch app. I can‚Äôt return now. Total waste for me
Vijay,2.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy this product,"Pros- No as suchCons- Touch screen is not effective and lags on frequent occassions, moreover when u install noise fit app on mobile, it is unable to detect. There is no back option and everytime u need to use home screen button to go back.Final Verdict - Not worth for money"
Shaunak Jani,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok product...,"Brightness is lesa, purchased for bigger font but fonts are smaller than band, there is no way to mark message read, you have to delete only or else will stay on the watch face...number of watch faces are less...heart beat measure also not working properly.... so many things to write..."
Prodyot Dutta,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very limited options and touchscreen is not soft. Doesn't worth for the price quoted.,All options are either works sometimes but you cannot really trust on the watch options.Just the look and outer design is good so you can buy it only for show that youvare wearing a smartwatch..good luck for the usage
Varun Punj,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy this pathetic watch from noise ho,Worst watch ever doesn‚Äôt keep proper track plus lots of in accuracy after latest update application broke on IOS platform pic attached. Instead go for mi watch I made a mistake choosing this one don‚Äôt. Moreover this noise watch do not have sedementary reminders.
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent fitness band,"PROs1. There are multiple watch faces to choose from & gallery photos too can be set as watch face, which is cool function2. ""Find my phone"" feature is handy3. Pedometer is largely accurate (but sometimes captures steps while driving car)4. Strap looks like made of silicone rubber so is comfortableCONs1. Display is not that bright, hence difficult to see time in broad sunlight2. Some additional features such as blood pressure monitoring or oxygen level checking should have been there3. There should have been button to receive call. It would be handy while driving."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Touch not working - defective piece,Touch was not at all working. Ordered replacement and now I realise that the first order was sent to some other customer earlier and though it was defective it was again sent to me instead of sending it back to the manufacturers. Pathetic service by Amazon.
Abishek,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cool product at this price,"The product features are appropriate for this price. The heart rate monitor, Spo2 monitor, notifications, sports mode etc. work perfectly. The sleep monitor works almost accurately. But I'm disappointed with the Alarms and BT Music features. The alarms don't ring on time and the BT Music is not able to control the music on my phone at all. Otherwise, I would recommend this product to my other friends."
Mahek,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice watch with basic functionality.,The colour looks damn good for my skin tone. I bought this to track my steps so that I don‚Äôt have to carry my cell phone while walking. Its accuracy is amazing. It even monitors heart rate. And also has a feature for women to track menstrual cycle which helped me alot. We can even upload any pics we want as watch wallpaper ( sorry I don‚Äôt know the accurate word for it ) All in all go for it only for basic functions. Totally paisa wasool.
Swati Raghav,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely ‚ù§Ô∏è,In love with this one just amazing. The touch is so responsive and this colour is just so perfect I can't describe...‚ù§Ô∏è
satish,1.0 out of 5 stars,Activity Tracker is poor,0 out of 5 in terms of accuracy.It counts the steps even travelling also.For 10 km of ride it shows 2000 steps.What is the use of the smart watch then.Pathatic experience.
Md. R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,This watch is waste of Money,No GPS it uses Mobile phone's GPS And says in built GPS is in The Watch Although its Not in watch touch screen of that watch is the worst I sent my watch for repairing after 2 - 3 months Same problems that occurred in my non repaired firstly buyed watch . This watch is waste of Money. the watch has nothing to be liked for And is worst watch ever tried
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worsted,"Watch look awesome but it's very slow and touch does not respond of many times..Colour fitpro 2 watch received last week, the connection automatically disconnected and many more time app uninstall and phone restart.I want return this noise watch but no any option for return process coz of Amazon policy 2 day jada hue na isliye"
Praveen Kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Nice fitness gadget. But not a good smart watch,"Got this for the first time and it was faulty.. watch to phone connectivity was not happening. If so it happens, the connectivity is not stable. No notification updated in watch. Hence replaced it and got the same again..It worked nicely for some time.. again the same happened again.Don't go for this product.It can be used as fitness gadget but not as smart watch."
malaya ranjan sahoo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Strap buckle faded with in 2 months,"Strap buckle colour faded with 2 months,I raise a complaint, they answer as color fading/discoloring/scratches is not covered in warranty as it comes under usage/handling of product.Please every one, rethink before you buy the product as you can see the quality of product and services provided."
Snigdha,1.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs a useless gadget,"A complete piece of crap. Does not track heart rate correctly (shows resting heart rate while doing intense workout) does not show sleep data. And even the pedometer is faulty. After having experienced Fitbit, honour fitness bands I thought of giving this a try. Huge mistake buying this"
K Sridhar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor product,Once replaced and facing same issues. Sleep tracking is totally out of sync. Wrist-up to wakeup the screen doesn't work. Outdoor activity readings are way off. Can only be used as a watch with colourful screens.
Chetan Nigade,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"The product is good for the price it is being sold. Accuracy is 3.5/5, look wise 5/5, battery life 4/5, screen response 3/5 but the main problem is with the application. Whenever the watch is out of Bluetooth range and comes back again in range of mobile it does not get automatically paired with mobile. every time you have to reinstall the application from the play store and again pair it. because of this all the data is lost and count start from ""zero"".i will not recommend this watch because of the application problem and makers of app also don't bother about fixing the issue.Go for mi smartband or any other band but just don't go for this"
Kaustav Das,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Smartwatch to Kick Start Your Fitness Goals,"This watch has helped me a lot when it comes to getting more healthy and fit. This is the first smartwatch I am using, and I must say that I am utilising it to the fullest. I am looking forward to a long journey with NOISE."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheapest and Worst.. Do Not Buy,"This watch is a cheapest model with no proper tracking. Calories burnt are never tracked properly and also if you are using iphone, workout mode is not available in fitness. You have to carry your mobile to start session manually. Customer care is pathetic with no response till replacement date gets away. DO NOT BUY THIS. Rather go for higher models."
Ranji Lal Indran,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not perfect but ok...!!,"Every option or features are some times not working properly... Especially Raise to wake option.. some time call alert not perfect... I think, It is suitable for children who are stubborn for want to watch"
SHUBHAMA KUMAR MISHRA,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wake up gesture,Everything is fine for the price with the exception of 'Wake up gesture'.The watch used a lot of force to wake up & the wrist had to be rotated a couple of times.Not so comforting to shake your wrist multiple times in public when you actually need to see the watch immediately.Rest all features are good for the price.I was hoping for a bigger display but that's why there is an Ultra fit pro if screen size is the deciding factor for you.
Nilkanth,1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged box dusty watch and charger missing,Box and watch is all dusty and shabby with many removed adhesive tape marks. And charger is missing. One of the most pathetic shopping experience with Noise

I got two different packings both the times and got to know that packaging got changed.Good that watch looks good.. touch is nice..Call notification function was not working well earlier and solution is lock that app in your recent tab.

MeOnAmazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Must go watch..... Light on pocket, high on looks and great on performance.",Amazing product for a beginner as it does almost everything that an expensive smart watch would with being pocket friendly.

Anil Rajbhar,5.0 out of 5 stars,4Star,"When I got it first time, I was unable to connect with my phone and I replaced it with new one. This time It works for me. Overall I would say normal smart watch which will come in budget."
Meera  A jagtap,2.0 out of 5 stars,Need improvement,"There was issue while first time setup. To pair the devices it‚Äôs take almost 30 min, need to install NoiseFit app 3 times. I think there is issue with iOS devices. Some time screen scrolling is giving issue."

Finally I was satisfied with this worth and looking for new versions too."
nehagupta,2.0 out of 5 stars,Upset with graphics and notification,I am upset with this product because after exceeding 5 messages and 2 chats of whatsapp it's won't display text complete on screen.

Shrawan A.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Budget tracker. Not a good buy,It's a budget tracker. The screen resolution is poor. The app is not so good. Also if you don't sync the tracker just before you sleep there is no way the app will have the step count since it resets post 12. So if you are tracking the daily step count its not a good device.

The touch is not bad as compared to other reviews, sleep and steps tracking is good, I loved the colour and its working very awesome, it also has cloud and the notification is well functioning, the pulse and oxygen saturation is functioning well.. I'm really very happy with this noise colorfit pro 2 smart wathch"
Cosine Solutions,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for the money,"Because of plenty of features, it is difficult to understand the operations. With the ""Outside walking mode"" needed the highlite of Steps not mile. Let me use some more days and will revet."
Sanjeeb,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of time and money,"Features like WhatsApp or call notifications missing. Blood pressure monitoring missing, call alerts missing. Useless product"
Anand,1.0 out of 5 stars,Non reliable and inaccurate: just a watch and not at all smartwatch,The media could not be loaded. ¬†This is just a watch. Workouts doesn‚Äôt appear in app. Sleep is very inaccurate. If Something work today you can‚Äôt be sure of it will work tomorrow as well. Touch screen is very bad. Writing this review after 1-2 months of usage. Cheap Chinese product.

Sudipto Sarkar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,Pros :Light weightVery good battery lifeFast chargingGood lookCons :Response time is not that greatBpm sometimes hangs the watchOverall i am happy with this watch as it serves my purpose
Hardik Panchal,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Value Of money, Very Good Product","Hi Nosie, This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with Bluetooth. You need to download noise fit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SNS, like WhatsApp, msg, Facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner)."
Mrigank jha,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst digital watch,Worst ever experience with this noise product. After 5 months of use watch stopped working and No response from customer service. Watch is in warranty but you can not redeem your warranty. Such a poor and non responsive management of noise.
Ranjan Das,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money.,"Accuracy,battery life good, touch is good but display is small. I used to wear big dial watch so that initially I felt little uncomfortable but now i am okay with this product. Packaging and delivery was good, nowadays Amazon is better than Flipkart in terms of delivery. Thanks Amazon."
Samarth,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just 2nd day and screen has a big line on the Top .. disappointed,"Was excited after receiving the delivery of the watch, but to my surprise i saw a line on the top of the screen on the very next day.. This made me disappointed and lost trust in online shopping now.. Asked for replacement and still under process.. will write the further reviews once i receive the replaced item."
om pr shukla,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok .good product but few issues found,1. Battery life is not as per company advertisement .2. When turn your wrist to see time screen does not wakeup . Some time without turning wrist its screen automatically wakedup3. Touch issue . Some time if you choose heart rate it's automatically start spo2
PB10,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smart enough,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Worth the buy. Does the smart tasks of tracking your activity and calorie burn which was my very needed requirement.Touch screen is good
Rajesh Shival,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of Money,Does not provide accurate information. This brand has just got better preforming brand ambassadors. But the product itself does not perform better. This product is a waste of money. This product is not worth more than INR 500. But still sold at a higher price.
Mr Kool,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice features in a small budget watch.,"I am using the Noise Colorfit Pulse for more than a month. Even if it is not made of a metal case but it still looks nice (no cheap look at all). Silicon strap is very comfortable and sturdy enough but the clip hearts my wrist if I wear the watch tight. Sleep tracking is good but not 100% accurate. More strap options (nylon, clipless, etc.) should be made available from Noise.Overall a worth buy in that price tag."
Chirag Mullick,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defected product,"pathetic product,i purchased the product in starting of Dec, on 23rd Dec this product suddenly stop working( It was getting charged and when taken our from charging, it shut down & don't start.)i am owning multiple watches & didn't faced any issue, & i purchased it as a gift & Noice sending defective products.Seriously!! its pathetic."

I couldn't return also even if I'm not liking the watch I have keep the watch, think twice before ordering because return is not possible unless any damage is there"
Vish,3.0 out of 5 stars,Watch storage is pathetic,"I have used the product for more than six months now here are the pros and cons. Good battery. Tracking accuracy is decent. Features are good- Watch storage is worst, it does not store more than a day, you have to make sure to sync everyday- Notification does not work always- Does not sync automatically."
Anand K.Pathak,1.0 out of 5 stars,dont buy product,"not work , no pair with mobile not user-friendly don't buy this type of noise productif i scan bar code page was not found , pair with Bluetooth pin incorrect errori was any type of noise application but no workvery bad experiencepoor quality"
Pawan Vijay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Valuable for Money,"After using for 3 days, i am here to write a review. You need to download Noise Fit Sport app for that and need to connect your watch. This product is well packed and user manual is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SNS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other apps. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Truly water proof(follow the IP68 standard). Dont use in salt water, it can damage.After 3 days of usage I still left with 70% battery. Its pretty good."
Bhuvesh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product.,Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.But now In sale this watch is Rs.2599By the way this watch looks good and I recommend to all my friends. They will also love this product.
Rahul Yadav,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't connect to any phone,"The media could not be loaded. ¬†I've used noise products earlier as well and the experience was pathetic and this time noise prove me right once again. This watch doesn't work at all. The app which it says to download doesn't exist on play store, if you download any other app it doesn't work at all. No customer care, no support. Worst product. Please don't waste your money on cheap quality products like this"
Preety,1.0 out of 5 stars,no need to buy .. doesnt look gud,small screen .. not to buy this .. looks worst ... intentionally they have put this type of wall paper so that any one can think of tht full screen vuew is there on watch ... noneed to buy it .. tried to return or exchange but they have not provided tht facility also
Meena,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome watch, durable and fully functional after 2 months. Totally go for it.",This watch is very nice. I have been using it for two months under normal conditions and it is still as good as new except for a few scratches. The screen is good and has a fast response time. The features are amazing and useful. Totally go for it if you want a lit smartwatch for less money.
Jagruti,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very less display time and keeps getting unpaired frequently with app. Waste of money.,"Very bad product. Keeps getting unpaired with phone app frequently. If its not paired, cannot even use it at all. Not even to see time.Display time is very very less. Display goes off every 10 seconds even if we are using the watch screen at that time. Have to frequently unlock.Worse part is, there is no return policy available for this watch. Once you buy it, you are stuck with it.Total waste of money."
anshul shah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"App should be improved,tracking should be more accurate as well as touch should be little better","Watch is good it's sleek as well good looking,only problem is sometimes the walking running tracking is not so accurateThere are less watch faces but they are good ones I think noisefit app should update their watch faces regularly as well as they should also improve their app compared to other watches appOverall I am happy with the watch if you want to buy a good looking smart fitness band and don't have budget this is the best option for you to go with."
mayank pratap singh,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Noise fit app having error, use noise fit sports app",The media could not be loaded. ¬†You should use old application for correct way of working of this watch correct application isNoise fit sportsAfter usage of 7months this product is completely wastof money due to giveng all figures incorrectly.

Narendra Kumar ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Noice - ColorFit Pro 2,"I think some R&D is required in the device.I was excited when got a first smartwatch (ColorFir Pro2), but in my experience got some observation and I would like to share with you all. Pls make sure before buying this product.1. Wrong measurement of heartbeat and footsteps, heartbeat showing in the air also.2. Device is disconnecting automatically.3. NoiceFit app and device is getting closed automatically when I tried to change the dial face.4. Other than it good like- Waterproof, display, touchscreen, looks, color, and quality."
Anirban Mukherjee,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad watch never buy this,Call/message/WA/FB no notification appears at all. Battery life is poor. Touch screen doesn't work smoothly.It is wastage of my money. Return policy is also very bad. It is nothing but cheating. Extreamly unhappy and dissatisfied.
Rawat,1.0 out of 5 stars,Low quality,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Yeah imported watch ki video hai only 1600/- ki. Ekadam mast mast.Iske aage noise watch ekadam bakwas hai
Amit kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth money.,"I received the watch on 14/12/21 and I returned it on 15/12/21.*Reason : it looses Bluetooth connection, hangs and restarts frequently. Often Screen does not wake up even after many movement of hand. So one can't see the time easily.* There is no return and money back policy. They will replace it with other piece. Although I was planning to add more amount and get a better one. Now I m stuck with it."
Paras,4.0 out of 5 stars,WATCH FACES,Product is good. Built quality seems nice expect the fact that should have made upper portion of watch mettalic. Display is wonderful (60hz). Tracking activity is far better then realme band . The thing I liked the most about the watch is the fact that we could customize watch faces in new update. It also provide some of extra watch faces on it's app.
Tanya kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice product,"I was satisfied with the product. With the features it offers at a competitive pricing, I would recommend anyone to look at this option. Few glitches which could be improved are Raise to Wake and Music connectivity. if you are playing music, you can't use anyother feature like Sports, stopwatch. However, the look and feel and the overall usage was pretty great. Batter lasted for 10+ days and it feels light on hand."
sameena,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good at this price,"Battery life is good, touch screen is good too. Sleep tracker doesafairly good job but i don't find it too much reliable. Good buy at this price. Also the strap color was supposed to be cherry red but its tomato red."
veera sampath,3.0 out of 5 stars,Customized Watchface is horrible and every time app software is irritating,"Watch is okay but app is so horrible , i complained so many times about software of app , now still one more complaint is not solved about ( for Customized watchface time is converting automatically 12 hours to 24 hours if I changed to 12 hours it is stable upto 1day only after that again it is converted to 24 hours )"
9634163084,2.0 out of 5 stars,The watch needs more updates.,"At first, I have faced many problems regarding the configuration of the watch with the software because it was showing connected but not notify me about the calls and chats but for now, the working of the watch is pretty fine with the software but the watch is not supporting Hindi font please update the same accordingly.I am receiving the Hindi text on WhatsApp but it is showing blank on the watch.The watch needs more updates."

Sourav Lahiri,3.0 out of 5 stars,An apple watch is afterall an apple watch,"I bought this because i like experimenting with budget friendly techno gadgets, but from the moment you take this in your hand you know this is cheap. The clock lags frequently, the device unnecessarily vibrates and shows noise logo frequently. Noise fit app is the worst when comes to health tracking."
neha,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor sleep monitoring,"Battery life is good. Touch screen is average. Heart rate and footstep calculation is good.Worst is sleep monitoring.If compared, honor band was far better."
Vasu Gupta,1.0 out of 5 stars,PATHETIC!,PATHETIC!DO NOT BUY!! WORST DECISION!!!It detoriates day by day!1. It won't even pair now!2.Nor they reply on Whatsapp number they so gladly provided me with on this review reply on Play Store!3. No notifications4. No features as provided in details of the product.I wish there was some Negative rating!
Prem,3.0 out of 5 stars,Some features not working,Sports mode is not working without connecting to mobile application. Even mobile application is slow and sometimes not responsive. Even replacement received is not working. Disappointed with quality of product
Harmeet Singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad connectivity with phone,The look of the watch is fine. It works ok as per the steps and all but very bad with phone connectivity and updates. Not recommended if you want to use it with phone. The history doesn't get recorded because of no connectivity with phone which means you can't track your past performances.
Praveen Kumar Mishra,2.0 out of 5 stars,Outdated,"The product seems outdated, there is no SPO2 monitoring sensor(which is a must in today‚Äôs scenario),there is no weather update, cannot track sleep on the watch( sleeping can be tracked only in the mobile app). So basically it‚Äôs outdated better to go for noisefit pulse if you can live without Blood pressure monitoring."
Sanjeev,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good product,Using For sports purposeHave been using it for 3days now and i have to say its much better than the other resonably priced smart watches in market now. Connectivity to the app is smooth without any issues. The watch faces can be customized. Health reading are correct by far. Battery backup after 1 day is use is 90 percentage. So i can expect the battery backup to last about 7 to 8 days.
Bharat Sharma,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall watch is really awesome,"I operate the function easily without Manual Book but bluetooth connectivity is not good because the bluetooth disconnect automatically and bluetooth range is also not good. I use this watch within 4-5 meters and I saw the bluetooth automatically disconnected. Touch is also not good, I think touch should be like a smartphone touch."

Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Stay away if you prefer Bezel less, AMOLED screens... Not for you","Well, I was impressed with the sleek design and size of the watch shown on the website... But do think before buying it.. Because the screen is very small compared to other little expensive smart watches... There are bezels...Also the screen is IPS LCD meaning it won't be as smooth as AMOLED... That was a huge turn down for me...Otherwise to use in daily routine it's ok.. not so good... It's just fine... If you want to keep track of the Workout and fitness go for fitbands and not this one..."
Avinash Birua,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad decision,"Not good battery life, bad touch screen, zero accuracy. Using a Google fit app on your phone is much better than buying this watch."
Harsh Aggarwal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay Okay Product,"I had bought it for my wife. As such its okay, look, feel and screen is good. However, within a month one screen is already coming blank. Need to call customer care for help."
Faisal Salam,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pathetic Product, Do Not Buy This!!!!!!","Have been using this watch for almost 2 weeks now and it was working fine till yesterday. From today onwards it has stopped working. After charging the watch to 100 percent, within 5 minutes watch shows low battery symbol and turns off. Tried charging it couple of times, but no luck. And the return period have now closed. Not sure what to do with this now."
Shakti Pratap,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smartwatch is good. But the app needs much work.,SmartWatch is nice but app is very slow.Faces don't load most of the time in app and its very hard to reconnect if you unpair.App need so many work to be done.
Deepak Ross,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad as I first thought,I regret buying this... Doesn't pair properly... Sleep tracker doesn't work.. And mostly the watch faces and fonts look cheap as.... Better go for another product....Update :Pairing issue was with the cell phone rather than the watch. The cheap display comes with the cheap price. Updating this review after the disappointing experience with mi band 5 which gives grossly inaccurate step counts. Compared to it this product is better.
Jayaprasad Shetty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Low Quality and Defective products,Within two months of purchase battery was not working.After long chase able to catch hold customer care for complaint.Instead of replacing the defective product they had sent same product after repair.You will never feel proud and happiness by having these type of repaired productsI simply say never go for this brand product
Nikhil L,3.0 out of 5 stars,Actual issues,"The watch works well performance and battery backup seems to be fine, but issue is with the connectivity in noise app.Developers of the app are just sitting idle checking all the reviews on playstore and just replying them but rather than updating the app by resolving all the issues, after 10-15 times of trying the app recognises the watch and connects it.All they want to do is to sell their products not to give the best service, smoothful experience for their customers.PATHETIC NOiSE SERVICE."
Vishal S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent product at this price,Good product at price of 1599. I have bought it for notifications and call alerts. Physical activities tracking have minor errors but at this budget all watches have similar performance.Battery backup was upto 20 days with moderate usage.Overall score- 4.5/5.0
PARTH SAHU,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth spending than amazefit.,"I am very much satisfied with the watch and I have compared the strap of amaze fit and noise ,the noise one is like a matt finish which is very soft ,But the amazefit is like rubber of bad quality and get degraded with body oil,cream etc which kill it to next levelOveral all I am fully satisfiedThe only thing if they can add I want 'change able watch face'"
shruti,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it- Doesn't capture historic step count information,This device doesn't capture the total step count for previous day's if you haven't logged an activity.I have used Redmi & Fitbit and their apps capture your historic step count that you can revisit.The product is flimsy. Redmi is better at the same price
Dhiren,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a toy watch ,not worth the features spoken in the display , poor output","Sleep function was not working ,Mobile call indicator not working consitently ,When order cancelled and returned the product ,received 190/ rupees less than the paid amount of the product , seller in nit transparent in his dealings ..

Never connects sometimes, never vibrates on calls, never play music etc.. it works on its own way.Requested for the replacement."
Avp,1.0 out of 5 stars,Highly over rated... not worth the money,I don't know how this watch received high rating. The watch does not reconnect to the app if once by mistake you go out of Bluetooth range(<2m). For reconnection u hv to reinstall the app and start again. Step count not accurate... Call notification - sometimes u get ..The watch is only useful for looks and shows time correctly which u could get at much cheaper rate.
Sanika gaikwad,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good!!,Overall I like the product. Easy to handle and all the basic sports activities are covered. Comes with 1 year warranty. Easy to register. Touch screen is good and able to track all the necessary details.
Sainath K,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bad notification sync, low quality display, But accurate tracking","In comparision to Mi Band , i realized that the notification sync is too bad, I see the notifications coming up after a lot of time. Additionally the display is such a low grade one. Also, the touch is not perfect. The only good thing is the bigger display and accurate tracking."

Teja,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy for 2k,Got it for 2k in a sale. My primary requirement was getting notified for calls. It does ok. The bluetooth keeps getting disconnected once in a while since I have an iPhone (typical native OS problems)
Zohra,3.0 out of 5 stars,Noise coloufit pro 3/5.,"It's not an all time sports watch. It doesn't give accurate step count and doesn't show km.Menstrual cycle too is a fixed course, there's no way to edit or change itrelating to the cycle.Heart rate isn't accurate too"
Parthi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good looking bad battery device,Actually watch appearance is too good for me. It's nearly accurate Heart rate monitor and all.

Dr Ravi Gupta,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product ever,"Worst product of till date in Amazon...still not having return policy...useless and very cheap product..better to buy a local digital wrist watch,it will be better choice..pathetic purchase.."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good premium product,"Good product and feels very premium, if screen turned off than it feels like mini Apple Watch. Screen is good, Touch is slightly lagging. Sometimes feels useless as very less sensors included. Must have included SpO2 (Oxygen) sensor. As in this pandemic time it will be boon for large population as Oxygen monitors available in market are very costly and of poor quality. It can save many lives"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective piece or substandard product.,With in few days the unit display has gone. Complete dumb.No proper response from the company for correcting the issue.Could not use return policy due to outstation on urgent work.Think twice before buying.
Chowdhary Abhishek ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good battery backup/Call notifications not working.,Watch is good lookin. Battery back up is good. I have one issue and I guess many buyers getting same issue i.e. call notifications function is not working may be there is some defective issue and time showing 24 hours and I already chose many time even unpaid and paired it. If possible kindly help with troubleshooting steps otherwise I'll go for return/refund
Chirag shah,1.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon was bad products and services,"Pathetic quality product, not even worth 1000 rupees. Its highly overpriced & is not as advertised. The heart rate does not work, its very slow & the touch does not even respond most of the time.Do not buy this product, its a waste of money!2,735"
Salman,1.0 out of 5 stars,The watch is not working properly,This could be the worst watch I could get like seriously I can't get notifications on my watch so I ordered a replacement for it and I swear the delivery guy was just cutting my calls and he didn't deliver me the product and also sent it back to the amaxon third class watch getting third class delivery I didnt expect this from Amazon very disappointed
basudev kar,3.0 out of 5 stars,Screen timeout setting is missing,Overall product is average won't say it's accurate but most irritating part is there is no settings for screen timeout or always on display.Hope company take this a feedback and improve it in next firmware update.
Shival,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mimics Apple watch in looks and works GREATTT,Dont listen the negative reviews the app is so respinsive and is connected all the time....just go for the watch.... Deducting one star as i got some scratches on the band when i received it else the watch work perfectly...
Yattendra Nag,2.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,The watch doesn't connect seamlessly. It's more of burden having it.I followed all the steps to connect as mentioned in pamflet. Nope not the product it should be and it's price.
Charan kumar reddy A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,This is a very good product and worth buying. The battery backup is also ver good. Every specification of the item is so good and are very much accurate. The only disadvantage is that if the notifications are turned on the battery will be drained more. It has the option only to cut the call and you cannot use it for speaking. The final word I can say is that the product is superb.
Praddyumn Bhardwaj,1.0 out of 5 stars,bad product,"Such a big disappointment with noise first time. the function of this watch works so slow and it irritates alot what i thought its just an opposite piece.

Deepanshu Janghu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best Battery Life.,In my opinion in this price range the smartwatch is best but if you have some more money in your budget you should go for Noise Colorfit Nav. But if you have a limited budget then go for it. This smartwatch is good.Some features that i like about this watch -:1 first of all the battery life is very good. One charge should last about 20 days with normal use.2 It's censors provide accurate hearthrate and sleep tracking.3 The chaging cable comes with magnet.
P Sharma,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money,"Value for money.Good features and looks.TouchScreen is good.Battery does not last as claimed.The strap quality could be a little better.Overall, a good smartwatch."
BRD,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best for women,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Good one and accurate pulse reading.. touch screen is not water resistant. Battery backup is awsome like 2days. I would like to recommend this watch
Kunal Chauhan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money,I am fully satisfied with the product. I have purchased blue colour and It looks good. Not like childish or toy kind of look. All functions are working appropriately. Good battery back as well. I am using the product since more than one week now.
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,NoiseFit app needs serious fixes,"1) sleep tracking was not upto the mark and it was not syncing properly with app2) Device was not syncing with the app and it‚Äôs takes lots of time to sync daily activities3) once the device is disconnected with app, no matter what you try it is not pairing with the mobile again. I‚Äôm using IPhone 1195% of the issue is with the NoiseFit app."
Varuni Dhuliya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Quality,"This product is meant to be with every fitness freak..and a person who needs a smart watch but cannot afford very pricy products...NOISE is one such company that has always maintained its standard and is worth its price. This smartwatch keeps track of walks,run, my sleep and in fact my ovulating times! The watch looks amazing and makes you look smart with even less accessories! Gonna buy NOISE again!"
Misha,4.0 out of 5 stars,You can't respond to Text or call but only can reject,Look wise it's Good. But i think this product would be better usefull for Gym going ppl.For me it not that much usefull. It give a smart look on your wrist btw.It has All features Like Sleep tracking. Heart breath measure etc etc.It shows time as well.But with this you can't respond to call & text messages uh can only can reject.Battery life is good.over all uh can go for it. I like it but not get what i expected.
Alex R.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good; but steps are not counting right inside home.,Walking steps are not counting correct when walking inside home; either it's doubling the count or no count. This is the only thing looks weird. Rest all functions good.
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very poor quakity dispaly and material,"The product doesn't have a return policy, it can be replaced only. The dispaly is not good compared to other smart watvhes in same segment. The light is dull. Materials used are felt low quality. Better to buy Amazefit which I had earlier and thought to give a try to Noise by seeing the reviews."
Suraj Chauhan ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product but poor aftersale service . Dont buy this,It is a nice product with good features. Looks stylish and can wear on formal as well as on casual.But very much disappointed with the aftersale service. My strap got broken & I want a new one black color strap from last 3week it is out of stock even not available on other online shopping platform. Because of strap I didn't wore my watch from 3 weeks. Kindly help to find black color strap.
Pulkit Chaudhary,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Watch is Worth to it!!,"Firstly I was very obsessed to wear the watch on my wrist like it seemed to be the most valueable and precious gadget I have ever purchased. On moving towards the watch I personally recommend all the ios watch users to come and have a look at this ColorFit Pro 2 smart watch, whenever I used to wear it I strongly get attached to the Premium type watch feeling it gives to me. Yeah no doubt the watch is worth to it but small dissapointments I'm facing generally with the app and limited watch faces in the watch. I hope this would be fixed soon.Thank you!"
Badulla G,1.0 out of 5 stars,No  return/cancel/exchange option and bad experience,Not at all working the sleep mode function and touch was worstBad experience with noise customer service. No point of contact via mail/request or callFinally no return/cancel/exchange option
Naveen Yadav,5.0 out of 5 stars,Intelligent device!!!,"This is good option in smart watch in this price band. Its design is impressive , battery life is very good and meets the claim. But interface with App sometime getting no response, needs improvement."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this watch,The media could not be loaded. ¬†Don't buy this watch as the company won't listen to your complaint if the product is faulty. I have made complaints many times and mailed them but hardly my compliant was heard or the item was replaced. Never buy from this company as they won't reach out to your complaints.
Naresh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value for money product,"The product is very good at a very competitive pricing.In future firmware updates, if option is included to wake up the watch by tapping on screen, it will further add to user convenienceAccuracy SPO2 sensor needs to be improved"
Vatsal Prajapati,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very useful product.,I use the watch to monitor my health. It does the job with fluency and is very comfortable to wear. The data is also accurate and reliable. all in all very happy with the product.
Aman Sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved this product !!,This product is so good. It records heart rate accurately & my sleep pattern has improved after using this watch. Watch design is very good. The strap colour looks very attractive. I did share my experience with this watch to my many friends and some of my friends bought it.
K.Sundararajan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Raise to wake up screen works only at times & not consistent,Good battery back up& sync with Google fit. Walking in work out sleep tracking are good. Touch to wake/fluidity is lacking. Raise to wakeup is highly inconsistent particularly not working when needed most. The watchface shown(pic uploaded) not available in the app. No way to communicate with the company.
Mohammed Azam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some thoughts about the watch.,Sleep tracking = the tracking is good and accurate I like that .Accuracy = the accuracy is good but not that good . Like if I simply move my hand the steps are increasing sometimes and when I turn the watch to my face it should turn on . But sometime is not turning on I have to press the button.Touchscreen= the touchscreen is good. But the sensitivity of the touchscreen is not that sensitive sometimes I have to swipe 2 or 3 time to open the menu or messages .
Milind,4.0 out of 5 stars,The coolest feature with the affordable price.,I used this for a while now it's almost a month now and I use it for fitness tracking and for notifications which saves my effort to grab out phone from pocket and watching notifications. I am giving 4 stars on basis of overall usage..the screen touch sensation would have been increased more. And the noise fit app also lags sometimes. Fitness tracking seems to be accurate in running and walking. Sometimes lag in sleep tracking. Overall a must use watch.
SAMI,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color is completely different,"Colour is not at all matching to photo, I changed also, but both the times, it disappointed me, (photo uploaded )"

BlossomChris,3.0 out of 5 stars,Colour is bright red and not as expected,Disappoined with the belt colour. The actual colour is bright red and not as shown in the picture. I expected a maroon shade or darker red.I will give more review on features after using it for few days.
Gaja,2.0 out of 5 stars,Need to give lot more updates which will make this item more smooth and easy...,"Build quality is up to the Mark....

DN,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad at all with the price tag,"I like the fact that the watch has tried to keep main categories like sleep tracking accuracy and touch screen yet priced it decentlyBut at the same time it lags and touch screen isnt so goodI would say for a person whose into fitness and wants to track basic heart beat and sleep and cardio, this is a good option"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Charger not working just after 3 months of buying the watch...,"Bought it in Oct20, worked well for the first 3 months and now charger is not working and without the charger, once watch battery is dead, watch is of no use......very disappointed....

Afrose,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth buying,"Noise colorfit pulse gives me absolute bliss and has good battery life. It's been a couple of months since I purchased and only 3 times I've charged the watch.

ShyleshKumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not so good,"Expectation of cost voice not acceptble,"
satya,4.0 out of 5 stars,Money waste products,"NOISE product should not be bought, the main accessories like charger of their products are not found anywhere, neither with them nor with any else, due to which their products become useless at one time, and if related accessories are found in their customer care by chance, then are charge for it 3X time. Thats the strategy of NOISE to generate revenue."
Saksham Dhull,2.0 out of 5 stars,Average purchase. Won't really recommend,The product has some basic features regarding fitness tracking and heart beat tracking. Notifications are also shown but the interface is not very good. The watch has some bugs in itself and needs improvement on the software level.
Rajat Ghosh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Buying this as a SMARTWATCH will let expectations down.,"Has limited feature. ""Smartwatch"" is not the word which justifies the product. This is just a fitness band with full touchscreen control and color display."
Vivek Gopa,1.0 out of 5 stars,Got Damaged product,Disappointed with service of Noise this time. I got a damaged product in the box and also it is a used product. Totally disappointed with this one.

Bhooma,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good one!,"So overall the watch is really good. It's light weight and the look and feel is good. The only drawback is the noise app has many bugs which doesn't allow any notification to be seen on the watch, even after enabling all the settings."
Abhi,1.0 out of 5 stars,Watch is having issue,I had buy this product in August and on screen incoming call alert and message alert was not showing later than I have exchange the product. And after exchanging the watch still I am facing the same issues.... I would suggest not to buy this product.

But the problem is solved .. I like this watch very much because I work on a more time bike .. I want to say one thing that smart watch is for a hobby or for the record of body movements (to a lesser extent). And useful for bike job. Its battery backup is very good. Thank you"
Suman pal,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product I ever buy.,Worst product I ever buy.1. Worst app.2. Does not have date wise activity data. Only you can view the current date data. You can't analyse your daily improvement.3. It's just a digital watch of rs 3250/-

Sibin Radhakrishnan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not value for money,"Not the best you can get at this price range.The watch turns off if the button is long pressed accidentally so the button is an issue and the main issue is that the previous data is deleted. Even the alarms, notification settings, everything gets deleted just when the watch is turned off. You have to do it all over again.The battery life is pretty good."
Prabhakar Mallya,3.0 out of 5 stars,Formation of rust during the charging process at the contacts.,"The watch is a very good, amazing product except for the formation of rust(ferrous oxide) at the charging contacts. I am afraid that with continuous charging, I am sure to lose these contact points making the watch useless. It is practically a new watch so should not happen."
Sudhir kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,"Doesn't have facilities of spo2,bp, and many more. Boat is very good in this price range"

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste,Pathetic...useless sensors.its a showpiece. Requested return and still waiting for amazon pickup person. It was scheduled for today but no phone call received.
Sunanda,2.0 out of 5 stars,Helpful Feedback that would help to take decision,"The product looks amazing in pictures but in real it doesn't keep up to the promise. Also very important thing they don't have RETURN policy, only allowed for replacement. So be very sure before buying it.The heart rate doesn't work most of the time.The touch stops responding frequently, even at times it seems not to work the way you want and the screen freezes.The watch looks cheap than the other hybrid watches available in the market. If you are very lucky the watch would work fine for you or else you would end having a product which doesn't work."
Upendra k.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Over all OK,It's just OK. Tracking activity is not accurate and Mobile App is also not working some time...Actually I brought this for its battery life but I'm not satisfied. Approx one week in a single full charge..
Faiz Mansoor Alam,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product,"Bluetooth connectivity is very poor it's very difficult to pair with phone and auto disconnect the bluetooth , not justified the price. Notification is not working, product features are not up to mark, only look wise good, it's not user friendly"

Jagruti parab,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not so good,Well look wise this is 10/10. But the problem I am facing every day is I have to connect watch every day by switching on and off Bluetooth then pair. Pedometer is not nice. Not showing exact steps count. Same goes with calories counting. While driving it adds 1000 steps approx automatically. Overall not happy to buy it. Can't recommend to anyone. Just bcuz I wanted square dial watch I bought this. Looks awesome but performance is not upto the mark.

Vikram,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Features...Bad Battery,The features and all the tracking are nearly accurate as advertised.Battery lasts for only 3 days as opposed to the 10 day advertised.

Prajwal Gowda,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only for the looks fitness watch,"The watch is good with looks but if you r looking for a watch that can track your fitness needs , then this is not the rightful watch. The stock app NoiseFit pro sucks and I have started to use VeryFitPro app and is far more less problematic than the stock app like random disconnectivity and all."
Lehar ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for the money and the best product for teenagers.,I am using the smart watch since 10 to 15 days the probuct seems to be a good fitness band in the budget of ‚Çπ1999. My little brother also bought the watch he was impressed by the colour and sports mode. It's a 5star rated product for me.

Anushka Nautiyal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight stylish watch for beginners.,It‚Äôs a nice watch very light weight and elegant.Though screen size is bit smaller compare to other brands but still its very comfortable. Charging is also very fast and it‚Äôs last more than 7-8 days.
Manikandan Meleveed,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not recommended,After 3 months of use I'm writing this review .It's a ok product. Not a perfect one. Pairing is little time consuming. Battery life is gud. Notification also shows after 3-5 sec delayed.
Isocline,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money.,Was skeptical of sleep tracking before I bought it. But it works great. Impressive. Bought it in festival sale for 1999. The regular price of 2999 seems a little high for the given features.
shashank,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt perform as required,Look is good but it doesn‚Äôt perform well as written. It has late sense with little issue of touch. It doesnt pop up call notifications even after concerning to customer care. Customer care service is also not appreciated.

Shivanand ojha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent smartwatch,"I liked everything in this device. This device works promptly but the app is little slow but ok for me .

Saptarshi Paul Choudhury,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,For the price it's good tracks most of the thing only lacks spo2 and you can't select watch face from 3rd party apps that's a bummer for me if your okay with this

Battery life is really good, with my light use, it is running upto 15 days with full charge. All basic features are good. The only problem I am facing is with the Noisefit app. The display in the app is so bad that I can't even scroll sideways/updown to set alarm for example. The app really needs massive upgrade."

PRAMOD,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent bet at the given price. Accuracy can be improved.,"I liked the overall features, it looks really smart. However, accuracy wise I am not sure how much we can rely on it as there exists a difference of almost 2K steps (average on daily basis with respect to Google fit and SSG, Noise counts 2K steps less approximately). Well, in a way its good as you will walk more to attain your target but I don't know what it will do your motivation level üòÖBut otherwise it's a decent bet at the given price."

Anil Kumar Madupu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Notifications are not working as expected,"It's a good looking smart watch at this price, but lot of scope for improvement.The main flaw I noticed is the call and message notifications not working as expected. Because it will need a Noise fit sport app to be working always in background in phone to stay in connected to phone. If the app is not opened the notification won't work. It's a pity."
pratik99pay,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont waste money and dont trust amazon,"Not satisfied with look , looking so cheap, packing also so cheap,amazon said easy return in 15 day i tried to return but now they saying that we cant accept return. Please dont buy this watch. Totally unsatisfied"

Tanu kashyap,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice watch,Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself.

Bought this one for Rs.2999.

Akshay,4.0 out of 5 stars,Update regarding.,"The color display is very good, and the band is comfortable to wear but its lack of customization options and poor UI prevents it from entering the category of smartwatches.

Senthil Ramanan,1.0 out of 5 stars,App not available in Google Play Store.,"Without an app downloaded, the watch is useless not even for viewing the time. No app available for download in Google playstore. Can only be downloaded from Apple store if you own an iPhone. Using the QR code for pairing doesn't work. It shows invalid device. Overall not worth buying with several glitches."
Aswini,2.0 out of 5 stars,Call & Message notification is not working,"Call & Message notification is not working. Always we need to open the noise fit app to connect. that app will affect the phone's performance. There won't be a return policy. Only replacement is possible. So think before you buy this watch.

Tushar Banga,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, a great buy in this budget.","Battery life is great. Works for over 10 days on standby. The touch could‚Äôve been much responsive and better.

Sunil,2.0 out of 5 stars,Connectivity issues,Often loses connectivity. Everytime either restart the phone Or the watch to get connected again.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pairing issue,The watch keeps getting disconnected from Mobile whenever I received a call alert or message alert.

Imran,4.0 out of 5 stars,After Sales service is miserable,Watch is good by look.Touch is little it slow in sensitivity. One thing I want to highlight about Noise that after sales service is miserable and far below expectations. I move to National consumer helpline to replace the strap of watch. Which I personally do not like. After sales services should be flexible and fast.

Rishi tripathi,4.0 out of 5 stars,Review,Overall the watch is very nice and good and very comfortable. But sometimes the battery drains faster even we keep the watch switch off at night and as company says battery will be of 7 days so its not last 7 days and in standby i did not checked .

Best part is its battery backup. 210mAh is giving 12-16 days backup for me & its amazing. Accuracy is good.

They present the product in video with good quality features but in reality it seems like kids toy watch. they are comparing this smart watch with apple's smart watch. i would say these day in this amount we can get the better product offline. Very much disappointed"
MEDHA AGRAWAL,3.0 out of 5 stars,The most important  thing is that you can't  set things in watch without using the app,I like how it is easy to use and I don't need to charge it frequently.

Looks like the Company is testing its beta versions at the cost of the Customers."
Sai Shanker,4.0 out of 5 stars,WORTH IN TERMS OF LOOKS,I will say it's worth in terms of looks. Also the prising is comparatively good. Sleep tracking and accuracy can give 4 Mark's out of 10 only. If you are looking for accuracy and sleep monitoring proceed with fitness band rather than this. If you giving priority for the looks and attraction this will suit for your money.

Anandhu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cool looking....,It looks cool and light weight. good touch response and app connectivity. step counting and heart rate may be not very accurate but its very good in this price range.
Dileep KS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Service is pathetic,"Service is patheticWatch touch screen is malfunctioning. When reached out for service center, no response. I feel Noise needs to know about this service requirement and product and customer satification. I never expected this kinda of a service from Noise."
GC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noise fit pro 2,"Great watch at this price point. However, because of the frame on the dial which is the same color as the strap, using another coloured strap would look odd I think.... I bought the steel grey one, so for the problem mentioned above, I recommend others to buy a black watch so that you can experience with different coloured staps."
Ashok,1.0 out of 5 stars,I think software issue,"I am happy with day one watch performance after that I will not happy to use the product.

The Rathore,4.0 out of 5 stars,Keep it in mind,"Watch at price range is good. Looks perfect. Other functions working almost good.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,A satisfying smart watch,I am having a great experience with this smart watch. And I am happy with its screen . This device gives feeling of Apple Watch also which is very satisfactory. Also want to appreciate the new feature of changing wallpapers from our gallery. Just you can update the firmware of it and the app can have a option of moving the time because it blocks the wallpaper.üòäüòä
k,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the buy!!,Its a good watch for beginners since it keep tracks of your body movement with basic functions. It comes with call and messgaes feature which can be linked through bluetooth but I dont use it generally since vibrates a lot and my phone is generally nearby meme so I get double notifications.
SAKET,1.0 out of 5 stars,POOR TECHNOLOGY.,The watch started showing up in a weeks time after purchase.service center had no repair options had to replace watch.i had to wait the more then 2 weeks to get replacement which was REFURBISHED.Although being less than a week old had to get an refurbished watch.not fair.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good looks good looks good looks,"Writing this review after using if for more than 3 months. The touchscreen sensors are as accurate as when bought. Once charged, it stays put upto 6-7 days atleast. Very nice product for the money worth the buy. The looks are so superior you can't tell the difference between this and the Apple watch. Buy this product without second thoughts."

Happy that bought this product. Thanks to Noise and Amazon."
Paul,4.0 out of 5 stars,Strap broken after 3months o use,Registered a complaint with Noise. The customer care executive said that strap is not included in warranty. For replacement have to pay around Rs.700. So I replaced it from nearby shop. Such a hopeless company.
raghavan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worthy of  üíµ,The Battery life is amazing along with full usage upto 10days. The sports mode is also equally very good in tracking the steps and calories burnt. But the application is not very appealing.. could improve in the App part alone.
